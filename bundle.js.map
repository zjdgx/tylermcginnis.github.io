In this post I hope to cover\\nfour different types of techniques and discuss the pros and cons of each. I’ll\\nbe covering Functional Instantiation, Functional Instantiation with Shared\\nMethods, Prototypal Instantiation, and Pseudo Classical Instantiation.</p>\\n<p>First off, there is just the manual way to create an object. An example would\\nlook like this:</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> tyler = {}; <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">//create an empty object</span>\\ntyler.name = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Tyler\\\"</span>; <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">//assign properties to that object</span>\\ntyler.age = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>;\\ntyler.homeState = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Utah\\\"</span>;\\ntyler.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span></span>{\\n   alert(tyler.name);\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This is not very effective. If we wanted to create another “person” we would\\nhave to re-code the entire object like below.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> joey = {}; <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">//create an empty object</span>\\njoey.name = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Joey\\\"</span>; <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">//assign properties to that object</span>\\njoey.age = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">25</span>;\\njoey.homeState = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Arkansas\\\"</span>;\\njoey.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n   alert(joey.name);\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Obviously this technique is not very effective if we have large code bases that\\nare dealing with very similar objects.</p>\\n<p>Let’s not examine the Functional Instantiation technique for creating an\\nobject.<br> There really are two ways to do this, first:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age, homeState</span>)</span>{\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name,\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">age</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.age,\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">homeState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.homeState,\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">sayName</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n        alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name);\\n     }\\n   }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and the second way of writing this is</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age, homeState</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> results = {};\\n  results.name = name;\\n  results.age = age;\\n  results.homeState = homeState;\\n  results.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n   alert(results.name);\\n }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>That’s much better than what we had earlier. Now all we need to do to create a\\nnew object is</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Tyler = person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Tyler\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Utah\\\"</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Joey = person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Joey\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">25</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Arkansas\\\"</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This way is not only pretty on the eyes, it seems to flow better than other\\ntechniques and you’re able to have real “private” variables if you set up your\\nclosure functions correctly. This isn’t possible on other the other techniques\\nI’m going to talk about.</p>\\n<p>Next we have Functional Instantiation with Shared Methods.<br> You’ll notice\\nabove that every time we call the person function, we’re creating a new\\nsayName() function. Why not just create another object outside out function,\\nthen create a sayName property of that object then reference that new object\\nevery time we want to use sayName?</p>\\n<p>Let’s see what this looks like below.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age, homeState</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> results = {};\\n  results.name = name;\\n  results.age = age;\\n  results.homeState = homeState;\\n  results.sayName = personMethod.sayName;\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> personMethod = {};\\npersonMethod.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name);\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">//later</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Tyler = person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Tyler\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Utah\\\"</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Joey = person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Joey\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">25</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Arkansas\\\"</span>);\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now whenever we call the person function, we’re referencing that\\npersonMethod.sayName method rather than creating a new one each time.<br> Now is\\nwhen things start to get a little tricky.</p>\\n<p>Prototypical Instantiation is another way to create an object.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age, homeState</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> result = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Object</span>.create(person.prototype);\\n  result.name     = name;\\n  result.age  = age;\\n  result.homeState = homeState;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> result;\\n};\\n\\nperson.prototype.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.sayName);\\n};\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Later</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> tyler = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Tyler\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Utah\\\"</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> joey = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Joey\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">25</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Arkansas\\\"</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In the code above, the result variable is now able to delegate to\\nperson.prototype on failed look-ups. For example, when we say person.sayName(),\\nthe browser checks for sayName on the person object, doesn’t find it, so it\\ndelegates to the prototype, where it is found and returned.</p>\\n<p>Now let’s analyze the most common approach: Pseudo Classical Instantiation</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age, homeState</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">/* this = Object.create(Car.prototype) */</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name     = name;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.age  = age;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.homeState = homeState;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">/* return this */</span>\\n};\\n\\nperson.prototype.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.sayName);\\n};\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Later</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> tyler = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Tyler\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Utah\\\"</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> joey = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Joey\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">25</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Arkansas\\\"</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So what’s going on here is that first, whenever we use the “new” keyword,\\nCar.prototype is set to be the delegator of the “this” variable whenever a call\\non the “this” variable fails. For example, when we say this.sayName(), the\\nbrowser first checks the person function for “sayName”, when it’s not found, (or\\nwhen it fails to find it), it delegates to the prototype, which then alerts\\nthis.sayName. This allows our function to be more flexible and really utilize\\nthe “this” keyword. Also, you’ll notice that since “this” is automatically added\\nand returned, there is no need to return that object since it’s already doing\\nthat for us. This technique is the industry standard and should be used in most\\ncases (unless you prefer functional instantiation).</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 434 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Steps to Implementing an Algorithm\",\"date\":\"2013-08-10T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/steps-to-implementing-an-algorithm-5714c47c579d/\",\"body\":\"<p>In order to understand how to implement an Algorithm, we first need to\\nconceptually understand what an Algorithm is.

Although\\nI’ve worked on Web Apps in the past, none of them have been this big. When I\\nstarted this project I had put up huge mental barriers. I thought I didn’t know\\nenough, I had no idea how I was going to take this awesome idea I had in my head\\nand actually create it. I could, and one day probably will, write a whole blog\\npost on overcoming mental barriers in Software Engineering. The secret? Well,\\nyou kind of just have to trust what you know and understand you’re going to fail\\na lot, but it’s in overcoming that failure that you’ll succeed. During the full\\nphase of the project I probably hit about 5–6 walls where I thought, ‘I really\\ndon’t know what to do now’ or ‘I really don’t know how to solve this particular\\nproblem’. However, with the looming two week deadline we had quickly\\napproaching, I had no time to just debug for 2–3 days and figure it out. I had\\nto do what was very, very difficult for me to do, forget the problem and have\\nfaith that eventually I would read something or run into the solution at another\\ntime. This is exactly what happened — every single time. One example of this is\\nI spent the entire day two Saturdays ago trying to figure out why my initial\\nModal was freezing and crashing chrome. I literally spent all day trying to\\nfigure it out. I was sure my\\n<a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18808295/closing-an-angular-ui-modal-on-a-socketio-event\\\">problem</a>\\nwas with Angular in that for some reason when I tried to hide the Modal, it\\nwasn’t working. Then I later realized that <a href=\\\"http://Socket.IO\\\">Socket.IO</a> was making a <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18815843/socket-io-event-being-triggered-twice\\\">Double\\nConnection</a>\\nwhich throwing everything off in my <a href=\\\"http://Socket.IO\\\">Socket.IO</a> rooms. I spent all day debugging\\nthen finally had to just move on. About 3 days later I was having similar issues\\non another section of my site. I then figured out that I was declaring my\\nController in both my HTML <code>&lt;div ng-controller = ‘myCntrl’&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> and in my\\n$routeProvider. This is the reason that everything was being triggered twice\\nwhich was then freezing my modal. By deleting one line in my code, I fixed two\\nvery big bugs I was facing.</p>\\n<p>As a whole, the biggest problems I faced were definitely related to Sockets and\\nmore specifically the use of rooms with sockets. For every connection that is\\nmade, I categorize that user into a specific room based on a certain algorithm.\\nBeing a live game, the user has the option to stay, disconnect, or refresh. This\\nleads to a vast array or certain behavior that could happen in one specific\\nroom. This behavior needed to be somehow connected with other rooms and the\\nbehavior of the users in that room. For example, if there are two rooms each\\ncontaining two users, the game needs to be able to detect if both rooms have\\nsomeone disconnect, and then pair those remaining users.</p>\\n<h4>The Outcome</h4>\\n<p>Overall, I’m very pleased with what I’ve created and I’ve received pretty good\\nfeedback so far. One of my <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/jakelingwall\\\">really good\\nfriends</a> back in Utah works at\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.domo.com/\\\">Domo</a> and was able to show off CoderCombat to a few of\\nthe developers there. One in particular is a guy I’ve looked up to for a while\\nnow and is probably the best developer in Utah under 30 (Merrick Christensen).\\nHe played Coder Combat and said “This is awesome. I’m impressed”. I was on\\nCloud-9 all morning yesterday. Although kind of weird, it’s an amazing feeling\\nwhen developers you really look up to enjoy the Software you build.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*v6n7OB2uBLwBXO0k.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 436 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Why Every Athlete Should Become a Software Engineer\",\"date\":\"2013-10-01T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/why-every-athlete-should-become-a-software-engineer-a9bfa0a59ca2/\",\"body\":\"<p>Until I was about 19 years old, basketball was my entire life. When I say\\nentire, I mean it was just about all I thought about and all I ever wanted to\\ndo. In my yearbook for senior year I still laugh when I see the ‘description’ I\\nput for myself under my name. I quote, ‘uhh…basketball?’. To me, basketball had\\nthree great assets. First, I could become as good as I wanted to become. The\\nonly thing holding me back was my personal dedication to improving myself.\\nSecond, people admire those things that you can do but they think they can’t do\\nthemselves. And third, you’re only as good as the team you’re on. Like all kids\\ngrowing up, I had big dreams of where basketball would take me. I understood\\nthat in order to play at a collegiate level, I needed to sacrifice things others\\nwouldn’t. I was known for being the kid who was always in the gym and always\\nimproving. Going into my senior year of basketball all my plans came to a\\nscreeching halt. While playing a pick-up game I tore my meniscus. Long story\\nshort, after a few months on crutches I ended up recovering for the first game\\nof the season but I was never the same. Once you have a knee surgery it’s hard\\nto tell your body that your knee is fine and to trust it. I had a pretty good\\nseason but not one of a future collegiate player. Junior year my team won state\\nbut senior year we came up short. It was a terrible way to end a ‘career’ and I\\nhad dreams about that last game for over a year when I was done. I spent a few\\nyears as a missionary and getting lost in helping others and learning Spanish\\nwas an amazing experience, but I still missed basketball and I still felt a\\nweird void in my life.</p>\\n<p>I’m still not sure what really got me into creating software, but the idea of\\nbeing able to create an emotional experience for people using nothing more than\\na text editor and an internet connection really fascinated me. When I started\\nprogramming, I was convinced I would never find a pursuit that I could really\\nlose myself in as much as I did basketball. I was wrong.</p>\\n<p>Basketball, and sports in general, give you the ability to become as good as you\\nwant to be. The barrier to entry is pretty low with basketball. You need a hoop,\\nand a ball. Hoops are everywhere and basketballs are cheap. You’re the only one\\nstanding in your way from becoming a great basketball player. Software is the\\nsame. Now more than ever there are so many tutorials, video lectures, and just\\nawesome resources for learning how to develop. To quote a favorite line of mine\\nabout the power of knowledge vs education, “ See, the sad thing about a guy like\\nyou is in 50 years you’re gonna start doing some thinking on your own and you’re\\ngonna come up with the fact that there are two certaintees in life. One, don’t\\ndo that. And Two, you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on a f&amp;$^%#* education\\nyou could of got for a dollar fifty in late charges at the public library.” This\\nquote directly applies to the state of online resources that exist. Education is\\nexpensive, but knowledge is free. You’re the only one holding yourself back from\\nbecoming an amazing developer.</p>\\n<p>There is something very gratifying in doing something that other people think\\nyou’re not capable of doing. Basketball players and athletes in general are\\nabsolutely amazing to someone who has never picked up a ball or tried to do\\nanything athletic. Watch some professional snowboarders then try to ride down\\nthe hill for the first time and you’ll instantly gain a huge respect and\\nadmiration for them. The same is true with Software Engineers. To those who\\ndon’t code, what we do is absolutely amazing. One of the biggest websites in our\\nday was made from a basic PHP form in a University dorm room. It’s obviously\\nscaled quite a bit from there but in it’s basic form Facebook is something that\\nan entry level developer can create in a few weeks. Software Engineering made me\\nfeel admired and almost magical in what I could create.</p>\\n<p>Last, but not least, as an individual athlete, you’re nothing without your team.\\nThroughout all of sports, this is the main thing everyone has learned. Now, can\\nyou imagine where our industry would be without the emergence of open source\\nprojects? No jQuery, no Angular, no Backbone, no Node, no Rails. This industry\\nis so amazing because of those people who didn’t care about pulling a profit.\\nThat’s what I love about Software Engineering. I find pure joy and satisfaction\\nfrom creating an app that those developers I look up to can enjoy. That someone\\nI’ve never met before can find joy and have an emotional experience with\\nsomething I built in my spare time is so exciting to me. Although I still love\\nbasketball and play it from time to time, becoming the best Software Engineer I\\ncan become is perhaps the most fulfilling pursuit I’ve come across in my life\\nand I think every athlete who experiences the same void I did should consider\\nfollowing the path I took.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 437 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Categorizing Sockets and Broadcasting to Rooms with Socket.IO\",\"date\":\"2013-10-02T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/categorizing-sockets-and-broadcasting-to-rooms-with-socket-io-27d6a57b4b96/\",\"body\":\"<p>The idea and execution of creating ‘Rooms’ with <a href=\\\"http://Socket.IO\\\">Socket.IO</a> and only emitting an\\nevent to users in that specific room is documented as overly complex, but it\\ndoesn’t have to be. This process is actually rather simple if you read the right\\nmaterial. For, <a href=\\\"http://codercombat.jit.su/\\\">Coder Combat, </a>I needed to use\\nSocketIO’s Rooms to create the one on one game play that I desired. This post\\nwill hopefully get you started on the right path of using <a href=\\\"http://Socket.IO\\\">Socket.IO</a> rooms.</p>\\n<p>First, to have a specific Socket join a room, on ‘Connection’, do\\nsocket.join(‘roomName’). Then that specific Sockets room can be accessed and\\nseen by doing io.sockets.clients(‘roomName’). Although convenient, I actually\\nfound that keeping track of rooms in this matter was frustrating because there\\nare a lot more methods and properties that each socket had so it crowded what I\\nactually cared about, which was the room. To fix this I just created the\\nfollowing variables.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> room;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> playerCountInRoom = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> roomCount = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> roomList = {};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>First off whenever a new user would connect, I would give that Socket it’s own\\nproperty of ‘room’ (socket[‘room’] = room) with room being roomCount.toString().\\nThis would ensure that every socket was then put in the appropriate room.</p>\\n<p>As you can see, I need a roomCount to be able to increment every time the\\nroom is full (or room % 2 === 0), and I had a roomList object that I would add\\nthe users to whenever a new user would connect. Now, I had this convenient\\nobject that basically mirrors the overly complex Object that <a href=\\\"http://Socket.IO\\\">Socket.IO</a> kept for\\nme. Once you actually have the desired amount of users in a room, emitting\\nevents to only those users is simple. Here’s the run down.</p>\\n<p><code>io.sockets.in(‘roomName’).emit();</code> This emits whatever you want to ALL users who\\nare in the room ‘roomName’.</p>\\n<p><code>socket.broadcast.to(‘roomName’).emit()</code> This\\nemits whatever you want to every user in ‘roomName’ EXCEPT FOR the sender.</p>\\n<p>Although you probably won’t use it, io.sockets.emit() emits an event to all\\nsockets connected to the server.</p>\\n<p>Last but not least <code>socket.broadcast.emit()</code>\\nemits whatever to all sockets connected to the server except for the socket\\nsending the request.</p>\\n<p>That’s really it. You just add a room property\\nto every socket, create a roomList object to keep track of which rooms every is\\nin, then you broadcast and event to only the room you want to receive that\\nevent.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 438 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"AngularJS: Factory vs Service vs Provider\",\"date\":\"2014-05-04T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/angularjs-factory-vs-service-vs-provider-5f426cfe6b8c/\",\"body\":\"<p>When you first get started with Angular, you’ll naturally find yourself flooding\\nyour controllers and scopes with unnecessary logic.

You’ll notice our controller is very ‘thin’. All of our logic and\\npersistent data is located in our service, not in our controller.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://reactjsprogram.com\\\"><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0DGs4v3Xr1T8s_fEtfjh-w.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></p>\\n<hr>\\n<p><strong>2) Service</strong></p>\\n<p>Perhaps the biggest thing to know when dealing with creating a Service is that\\nthat it’s instantiated with the ‘new’ keyword. For you JavaScript gurus this\\nshould give you a big hint into the nature of the code. For those of you with a\\nlimited background in JavaScript or for those who aren’t too familiar with what\\nthe ‘new’ keyword actually does, let’s review some JavaScript fundamentals that\\nwill eventually help us in understanding the nature of a Service.</p>\\n<p>To really see the changes that occur when you invoke a function with the ‘new’\\nkeyword, let’s create a function and invoke it with the ‘new’ keyword, then\\nlet’s show what the interpreter does when it sees the ‘new’ keyword. The end\\nresults will both be the same.</p>\\n<p>First let’s create our Constructor.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name = name;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.age = age;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This is a typical JavaScript constructor function. Now whenever we invoke the\\nPerson function using the ‘new’ keyword, ‘this’ will be bound to the newly\\ncreated object.</p>\\n<p>Now let’s add a method onto our Person’s prototype so it will be available on\\nevery instance of our Person ‘class’.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">Person.prototype.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'My name is '</span> + <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name)\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now, because we put the sayName function on the prototype, every instance of\\nPerson will be able to call the sayName function in order alert that instance’s\\nname.</p>\\n<p>Now that we have our Person constructor function and our sayName function on its\\nprototype, let’s actually create an instance of Person then call the sayName\\nfunction.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> tyler = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> Person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>);\\ntyler.sayName() <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// alerts 'My name is Tyler'</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So all together the code for creating a Person constructor, adding a function to\\nit’s prototype, creating a Person instance, and then calling the function on its\\nprototype looks like this.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name = name;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.age = age;\\n}\\n\\nPerson.prototype.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'My name is '</span> + <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name)\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> tyler = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> Person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>);\\ntyler.sayName() <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// alerts 'My name is Tyler'</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now let’s look at what actually is happening when you use the ‘new’ keyword in\\nJavaScript. First thing you should notice is that after using ‘new’ in our\\nexample, we’re able to call a method (sayName) on ‘tyler’ just as if it were an\\nobject — that’s because it is. So first, we know that our Person constructor is\\nreturning an object, whether we can see that in the code or not. Second, we know\\nthat because our sayName function is located on the prototype and not directly\\non the Person instance, the object that the Person function is returning must be\\ndelegating to its prototype on failed lookups. In more simple terms, when we\\ncall tyler.sayName() the interpreter says “OK, I’m going to look on the ‘tyler’\\nobject we just created, locate the sayName function, then call it. Wait a\\nminute, I don’t see it here — all I see is name and age, let me check the\\nprototype. Yup, looks like it’s on the prototype, let me call it.”.</p>\\n<p>Below is code for how you can think about what the ‘new’ keyword is actually\\ndoing in JavaScript. It’s basically a code example of the above paragraph. I’ve\\nput the ‘interpreter view’ or the way the interpreter sees the code inside of\\nnotes.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// The next line creates an object that will</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// delegate to the person's prototype on failed lookups.</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">//var obj = Object.create(Person.prototype);</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// The next line sets 'this' to the newly created object</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// this = obj;</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name = name;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.age = age;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// return this;</span>\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now having this knowledge of what the ‘new’ keyword really does in JavaScript,\\ncreating a Service in Angular should be easier to understand now.</p>\\n<p>The biggest thing to understand when creating a Service is knowing that Services\\nare instantiated with the ‘new’ keyword. Combining that knowledge with our\\nexamples above, you should now recognize that you’ll be attaching your\\nproperties and methods directly to ‘this’ which will then be returned from the\\nService itself. Let’s take a look at this in action.</p>\\n<p>Unlike what we originally did with the Factory example, we don’t need to create\\nan object then return that object because, like mentioned many times before, we\\nused the ‘new’ keyword so the interpreter will create that object, have it\\ndelegate to it’s prototype, then return it for us without us having to do the\\nwork.</p>\\n<p>First things first, let’s create our ‘private’ and helper function. This should\\nlook very familiar since we did the exact same thing with our factory. I won’t\\nexplain what each line does here because I did that in the factory example, if\\nyou’re confused, re-read the factory example.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">app.service(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'myService'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">$http, $q</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> baseUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term='</span>;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _artist = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _finalUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> makeUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    _artist = _artist.split(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">' '</span>).join(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'+'</span>);\\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'</span>;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> _finalUrl;\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now, we’ll attach all of our methods that will be available in our controller to\\n‘this’.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">app.service(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'myService'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">$http, $q</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> baseUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term='</span>;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _artist = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _finalUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> makeUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    _artist = _artist.split(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">' '</span>).join(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'+'</span>);\\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'</span>;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> _finalUrl;\\n  }\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.setArtist = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">artist</span>) </span>{\\n    _artist = artist;\\n  }\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.getArtist = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> _artist;\\n  }\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.callItunes = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    makeUrl()\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> deferred = $q.defer();\\n    $http({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">method</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'JSONP'</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">url</span>: _finalUrl\\n    }).success(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">data</span>) </span>{\\n      deferred.resolve(data);\\n    }).error(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n      deferred.reject(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'There was an error'</span>);\\n    })\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> deferred.promise;\\n  }\\n\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now just like in our factory, setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes will be\\navailable in whichever controller we pass myService into. Here’s the myService\\ncontroller (which is almost exactly the same as our factory controller).</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">app.controller(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'myService'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">$scope, myService</span>) </span>{\\n  $scope.data = {};\\n  $scope.updateArtist = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    myService.setArtist($scope.data.artist);\\n  }\\n\\n  $scope.submitArtist = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    myService.callItunes()\\n      .then(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">data</span>) </span>{\\n        $scope.data.artistData = data;\\n      }, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">data</span>) </span>{\\n        alert(data);\\n      })\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Like I mentioned before, once you really understand what ‘new’ does, Services\\nare almost identical to factories in Angular.</p>\\n<p><strong>3) Provider</strong></p>\\n<p>The biggest thing to remember about Providers is that they’re the only service\\nthat you can pass into the app.config portion of your application. This is of\\nhuge importance if you’re needing to alter some portion of your service object\\nbefore it’s available everywhere else in your application. Although very similar\\nto Services/Factories, there are a few differences which we’ll discuss.</p>\\n<p>First we set up our Provider in a similar way we did with our Service and\\nFactory. The variables below are our ‘private’ and helper function.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">app.provider(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'myProvider'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">$http, $q</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> baseUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term='</span>;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _artist = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _finalUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Going to set this property on the config fn below</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.thingFromConfig = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> makeUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    _artist = _artist.split(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">' '</span>).join(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'+'</span>);\\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'</span>;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> _finalUrl;\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><em>Again if any portion of the above code is confusing, check out the Factory\\nsection where I explain what it all does it greater details.</em></p>\\n<p>You can think of Providers as having three sections. The first section is the\\n‘private’ variables/functions that will be modified/set later (shown above). The\\nsecond section is the variables/functions that will be available in your\\napp.config function and are therefore available to alter before they’re\\navailable anywhere else (also shown above). It’s important to note that those\\nvariables need to be attached to the ‘this’ keyword. In our example, only\\n‘thingFromConfig’ will be available to alter in the app.config. The third\\nsection (shown below) is all the variables/functions that will be available in\\nyour controller when you pass in the ‘myProvider’ service into that specific\\ncontroller.</p>\\n<p>When creating a service with Provider, the only properties/methods that will be\\navailable in your controller are those properties/methods which are returned\\nfrom the $get() function. The code below puts $get on ‘this’ (which we know will\\neventually be returned from that function). Now, that $get function returns all\\nthe methods/properties we want to be available in the controller. Here’s a code\\nexample.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.$get = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">$http, $q</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n    <span

Let’s see an example of that.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">app.config(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">myProviderProvider</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Note that NG appends 'Provider' to the end of the provider name.</span>\\n  myProviderProvider.thingFromConfig = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'This sentence was set in app.config.

The\\nnot so obvious conclusion, however, is what exactly you should program and what\\nlanguage you should learn to program. Society enjoys grouping programmers\\ntogether as if we’re all just movers of bits. Although technically true, we must\\nremember that although an airplane moves people and a mover moves furniture,\\nthey both serve two different purposes and both attempt to accomplish different\\ngoals. Thus is the same with programmers and programming languages. If a\\nJavaScript engineer is the airplane, a Ruby engineer is the mover. At a\\nfundamental level they do the same thing, but their goals and how they\\naccomplish those goals are drastically different. When deciding which language\\nto learn, you first should decide what your current and future goals are, then\\npick which language will help you arrive at those goals.</p>\\n<p>When I first started learning to program I had three goals. One, I wanted to\\nbuild web applications. When I was five years old, there were 45 million, or\\nalmost 1% of the world population using the internet. Now, not even twenty years\\nlater, there are 2.9 billion internet users composing 40% of the world’s\\npopulation. The internet has and will continue to define my generation and\\ngenerations to come and I wanted to be apart of that movement. Two, I wanted to\\nlearn something that would continue to be relevant into the future and one that\\nwould continue to progress and mature. I love learning. Learning makes me happy.\\nI wanted a programming language that would never stagnate so my skills wouldn’t\\nstagnant along with it. Three, if I had an idea, or someone else had an idea I\\nbelieved in, I wanted to have the skills to build it. We are living in a time\\nwhere you can connect with 2.9 billion people while your cost of goods sold is\\nnegligible. While weighing all of these options, the language that won in every\\ncategory was JavaScript.</p>\\n<p>If you’re a Software Engineer who has been under a rock for the last five years,\\nyou still think of JavaScript as a dinky scripting language which helps change a\\nbutton’s color when you mouse over it. That couldn’t be further from the truth.\\nJavaScript has very quickly progressed into a powerful language for building web\\napplications, think Gmail or PayPal. JavaScript is the ‘language of the web’,\\nand as talked about earlier — that’s a great thing. The web is everywhere, on\\nyour computer, phone, in your car and it’s continuing to swallow the world. But\\nwhat makes JavaScript even more interesting now is we’ve built tools that allow\\nus to write JavaScript code in more than just a web browser.</p>\\n<p>There are typically two types of programmers for the web. Front-end Engineers\\nand back-end Engineers. Front-end engineers work typically in HTML, CSS, and\\nJavaScript and they make web applications look pretty while also sending\\nrequests to the ‘back-end’ in order to receive different types of data. Think\\nFacebook. When you click the thumbs up icon, the browser (or front-end) notices\\nyou clicked the icon, it will then tell the back-end “Hey, Tyler likes Mikenzi’s\\npost about her dog, make sure that gets saved somewhere”. If everything went\\nwell, the back-end responds with “Sounds good, that information has been saved”.\\nAt a very high level that’s how the web works. It’s the back-end engineers role\\nto write code that listens for requests from the front-end, and responds\\naccordingly. JavaScript used to be a language for front-end engineers only.\\nHowever, with the invention of Node.js, JavaScript can, and is very often used\\n(Wal-mart, PayPal), as a back-end language. This was huge for JavaScript\\nengineers. Now instead of having to learn a whole different language to write\\nback-end code, JavaScript engineers can stick to what they’re good at,\\nJavaScript. Right now you might be thinking, “well that’s cool, but I’m a big\\nbeliever in iPhone or Android apps and I think that’s the future”. Though you’re\\nwrong, here’s why you should still learn JavaScript. Believe it or not, **you\\ncan write iPhone apps or Android apps using JavaScript and submit those apps to\\nthe Apps Store. There’s a technology called Phonegap (<a href=\\\"http://phonegap.com/\\\">http://phonegap.com/</a>) that\\nallows you to take your JavaScript code, and wrap it in a iPhone or Android app.\\n**Though your Phonegap application is going to lack the performance of native\\niPhone apps (which is why iPhone app developers still have very nice jobs), it’s\\ncomforting to know if you wanted to build an iPhone app with JavaScript, you\\ncould. It’s as if Gandalf the White was able to take over Dumbledore’s\\nHeadmaster position at Hogwarts when he died. You get the best of both worlds.\\nCan you now see why JavaScript won’t be going anywhere anytime soon? It’s too\\nembedded into our daily lives. Even with Apple’s release of their new\\nprogramming language “Swift”, Apple is taking a steps away from C like languages\\nand a step closer to JavaScript like languages — which is fantastic news for\\nJavaScript developers.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*34M01dsNfyFG8z4k.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Still don’t believe me? Above is a graph of the amount of new repositories (code\\nbases) created on Github (a web app where programmers can save their code) by\\nyear. JavaScript is consistently at the top of lists like this because it’s\\neverywhere and it continues to progress and grow. Python, a language taught at\\nUniversities throughout the country was once a staple as a back-end language.\\nHowever, with the rise of different technologies like Node.js and Google’s\\nnewest back-end language ‘Go’, Python is quickly becoming a language that’s\\ntaught in academia but not used in the real world. You don’t want to learn a\\nlanguage that’s trending down. JavaScript is the George Clooney of programming\\nlanguages. It gets better with age.</p>\\n<p>Although we’ve covered a lot, there’s one important fact about JavaScript that I\\nstill haven’t mentioned that makes it perfect for people who are learning\\noutside the normal confinement of academia. JavaScript is very rarely taught in\\nacademia, and if it is, it’s uncomfortably bad. Professors still hold strong to\\nthe notion of JavaScript as a dinky scripting language, which their students\\nthen reflect going forward with their careers. This is terrible if you’re in\\nacademia (or care at all about how our education system is constantly behind\\nwhen it comes to technology, which you should). But if you’re learning outside\\nof academia, this is a huge advantage to JavaScript. You’re not directly\\ncompeting with the tens of thousands of students studying Computer Science. This\\nmakes finding a job a whole lot easier.</p>\\n<p>JavaScript has changed, and will continue to change, the way we interact with\\ntechnology. Like the 2015 Cleveland Cavaliers, it’s ok if you jump on the\\nbandwagon, because everybody is doing it.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 440 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Book Review: JavaScript Patterns (4.5/5)\",\"date\":\"2014-09-15T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/book-review-javascript-patterns-4-5-5-cc1f22efc4e7/\",\"body\":\"<p>As someone already very familiar with the JavaScript landscape, it’s difficult\\nto find a book that’s at the right level.

As an outsider and\\n(self proclaimed) advocate of Firebase, here’s my opinions on why Firebase was\\nable to accomplish what they did.</p>\\n<p>First, and the obvious point, Firebase is a fantastic product. I’m the lead\\ninstructor at a ‘Learn to Code’ bootcamp. Firebase is such an easy sell.\\nCreating brand advocates is easy when you have a product that is solving a\\nrather large pain point while also adding more features on top of it. For\\nexample, an often overlooked feature of Firebase is Facebook/Google/Custom\\nauthentication. It’s dead simple. Also for anyone who has used AngularFire, you\\nknow how well Angular and Firebase work together. Three way data binding is like\\nwhen Taco Bell joined forces with Doritos. Separated they’re great but when they\\ncombine, you start to look at the world differently. React and Firebase are also\\nfantastic together (but because I have no other analogy to represent anything\\nbetter than TacoBell and Doritos, I won’t attempt another).</p>\\n<p>Second, the Firebase team has done an impressive job at putting themselves out\\nthere and are very involved in the developer community. I spent a summer out in\\nSan Francisco last year. This is when I first discovered Firebase and met some\\nof their team. Out of all the Meetups I went to, there was a Firebase\\nrepresentative at every one (minus the Meteor meetup…for obvious reasons). I’m\\nfairly confident the Firebase team figured out a way to clone their employees.\\nSara, developer advocate, is everywhere — and always happy. Regardless if she is\\nactually a real person or not, she and many others have managed to put a face to\\ntheir software. I moved back to Utah after my stay in San Francisco and I was\\npleasantly surprised that the Firebase community in Utah was just as strong as\\nthe one in San Francisco. In fact, there were bigger advocates of Firebase in\\nUtah than those I met in SF.</p>\\n<p>Third, hustle. I know ‘hustle’ can have an almost derogatory meaning, but when\\nit comes to a scrappy startup, I would argue it’s a good thing. This kind of\\nties in with the ‘Firebase is everywhere’ comment from earlier. I talked with\\nAlex the VP of User Experience last year and he mention their goal at Firebase\\nis to ‘fundamentally change the internet’. That’s a rather large goal but\\neveryone there realizes that and they’ve all drunk (or dranken? drank maybe?)\\nthe KoolAid, if you will. Every release they’ve done, whether it’s updating the\\ndocs, AngularFire 0.8, or adding hosting has been followed by extreme support\\nfrom the developer community — even on HN where <a href=\\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4396747.\\\">people hate you by default\\nunless you tell them you hate them\\nfirst</a> (JK HN. We’re cool,\\nright?). Because they’re so involved in the community, they’ve understood what\\ntheir product was lacking and how to fix it, then they executed.</p>\\n<p>Fourth, social media (also Hustle). Have you ever mentioned anything about\\nFirebase on twitter? At nights when I’m lonely and feeling down, I tweet\\nsomething about Firebase. Each tweet is guaranteed to get at least 15% of the\\nFirebase team to favorite it. Really, checkout <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis33/status/461275369924853761\\\">this\\ntweet</a>. 16\\nFavorites. 7 Retweets. I don’t care who you are, if you’re pulling in 7 retweets\\nwith a tweet, that’s going to make the girl who dumped you and got married 3\\nmonths later question her decision.</p>\\n<p>Fifth, a very talented but down to earth team. Being a big supporter of Firebase\\nI’ve gotten to know some of the team on a ~first name basis. They genuinely care\\nabout their developers and (don’t send me Google hate tweets for this line) have\\ntheir developers best interests in mind. During my time in San Francisco when my\\nWife and I were deciding where we wanted to end up (Salt Lake vs SF) I\\ninterviewed at Firebase. Although I didn’t get an offer, it was one of the most\\npleasant interview experiences I had. Alex (VP of UX) responded very\\nprofessionally and listed how my experience didn’t align with what they were\\nlooking for at that time. Though hard to swallow, it was totally fair and he\\nlisted out all the facts so it wasn’t really debatable. As the norm Alex wished\\nme the best and told me to keep in touch. Six months later I received an email\\nfrom Alex asking me how I was doing in Utah, where I ended up working, and if I\\nwas ever in SF to let him know and we would grab lunch. Turns out I was going to\\nSF the next week so as I was there Alex, myself, and the UI team grabbed lunch.\\nIt’s that kind of attitude selfless mentality that, as an outsider, radiates\\nfrom the inside out from their product to their employees.</p>\\n<p>I realize this post is super fanboy’ish, but it’s partly because I am a fan boy.\\nThough Google doesn’t have the best track record, I’m not (as of 10/21/14)\\nconcerned about them ruining the product. For me, Firebase has been more than\\nlightning fast three way data binding magic, and unless Google does something\\nexponentially (or 2^n time complexity) bad — it can’t take that away.</p>\\n<p>ps. *So it turns out that James Tamplin (Firebase CEO) looks uncomfortably similar\\nto Ryan Key (Yellowcard lead singer). If this is indeed not a coincidence and\\nthey are in fact the same person, disregard this article. My love of Yellowcard\\nas a 13 year old boy has clouded my judgement of good software.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*sO3NB7mjKxpDjxOA.\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 442 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"React Tutorial Pt 1: A Comprehensive Guide to Building Apps with React.js\",\"date\":\"2015-01-12T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/react-js-tutorial-pt-1-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react-js-8ce321b125ba/\",\"body\":\"<hide-from-preview>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Table of Contents:</p>\\n<p><strong><a href=\\\"http://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/\\\">Pt I: A Comprehensive Guide to Building Apps with\\nReact.js.</a></strong></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://tylermcginnis.com/react-js-tutorial-1-5-utilizing-webpack-and-babel-to-build-a-react-js-app/\\\">Pt 1.5: Utilizing Webpack and Babel to build a React.js\\nApp</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-pt-2-building-react-applications-with-gulp-and-browserify/\\\">Pt II: Building React.js Apps with Gulp, and\\nBrowserify.</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-pt-iii-architecting-react-js-apps-with-flux/\\\">Pt III: Architecting React.js Apps with\\nFlux.</a></p>\\n<p><s>Pt IV: Add Routing to your React App with React Router.

There has never been a better time to take the leap and\\nstart learning React. The difficulty starting out with React isn’t React itself.\\nIt’s important to remember React is “just the V in MVC” or “just the view\\nlayer”. Comparing React to Angular or React to Ember is unfair because React\\nisn’t trying to be a full fledged framework. It’s just trying to be the view\\nlayer, which it’s really good at. This brings up issues for developers who are\\ntrying to learn React. React isn’t difficult to learn; putting all of the pieces\\ntogether to build a full web application in React is.</p>\\n<p>As you’ve started to learn React you’ve probably ran into this problem. You read\\nfacebook’s documentation, read a few tutorials, maybe even watched some Egghead\\nvideos. You started feeling pretty comfortable with React. Then you realized “I\\nfeel comfortable with React, but I still don’t think I can actually build\\nanything meaningful with it”. I think that’s a thought that everyone learning\\nReact has. This goes back to the point of React. If you just learned the “V” in\\nMVC, you would still feel pretty worthless. This React.js tutorial series is\\ngoing to focus on addressing that concern. We’re going to first start off\\nlearning about the fundamentals of React. You’ll get comfortable with React\\nitself from props to state to JSX and everything in between. After learning\\nabout the fundamentals of React we’re going to jump into all of the other\\ncomponents (pun slightly intended) that are needed to build a full web\\napplication using React.js. We’ll cover how to use Gulpto set up a nice build\\nprocess for converting React’s HTML like syntax called JSX to JavaScript. We’ll\\ntalk about using Browserify to tie all of our components together. We’ll then\\ndive into the Flux architecture and see how Flux can help us structure and\\narchitect our React application in an efficient manner. Next we’ll talk about\\npersisting our data with Firebase and using React Router for, you guessed it,\\nintroducing routing into our app. After that, we’ll put it all together and\\nbuild a “<a href=\\\"http://tylermcginnis.github.io/react-github-notetaker\\\">Github Note\\nTaker</a>” app, an app that\\nallows you to save notes and see a snapshot of a developers Github account\\n(potentially useful for tech interviews where you want to take notes on a\\nparticular candidate). I realize this is a lot, but when I first started\\nlearning React I was frustrated with the lack of tutorials focused on putting\\nall the pieces of React together. This tutorial series hopes to fill that gap.</p>\\n<h4><strong>React.js Fundamentals:</strong></h4>\\n<p>Components are the building blocks of React. If you’re coming from an Angular\\nbackground, components are very similar to Directives. If you’re coming from a\\ndifferent background, they’re essentially widgets or modules. You can think of a\\ncomponent as a collection of HTML, CSS, JS, and some internal data specific to\\nthat component. I like to think of React components as the Kolaches of the web.\\nThey have everything you need, wrapped in a delicious composable bundle. These\\ncomponents are defined either in pure JavaScript or they can be defined in what\\nthe React team calls “JSX”. If you decide to use JSX (which you most likely\\nwill, it’s pretty standard — and it’s what we’ll use for this tutorial), you’ll\\nneed some compile stage to convert your JSX to JavaScript, we’ll get to this\\nlater.</p>\\n<p>What makes React so convenient for building user interfaces is that data is\\neither received from a component’s parent component, or it’s contained in the\\ncomponent itself. Before we jump into code, let’s make sure we have a high level\\nunderstanding of components.</p>\\n<p>Above we have a picture of my Twitter profile. If we were going to re-create\\nthis page in React, we would break different sections up into different\\ncomponents (highlighted). Notice that components can have nested components\\ninside of them. We might name the left component (pink) the “UserInfo”\\ncomponent. Inside the UserInfo component we have another component (orange),\\nthat we could call the “UserImages” component. The way this parent/child\\nrelationship works is our UserInfo component, or the parent component, is where\\nthe ‘state’ of the data for both itself and the UserImage component (child\\ncomponent) lives. If we wanted to use any part of the parent component’s data in\\nthe child component, which we do, we would pass that data to the child component\\nas an attribute. In this example, we pass the UserImage component all of the\\nimages that the user has (which currently live in the UserInfo component). We’ll\\nget more into the details of the code in a bit, but I want you to understand the\\nbigger picture of what’s happening here. This parent/child hierarchy makes\\nmanaging our data relatively simple because we know exactly where our data lives\\nand we shouldn’t manipulate that data anywhere else.</p>\\n<p>The topics below are what I believe to be the fundamental aspects of React.

Now,\\nlet’s jump into some code.</p>\\n<h4>Creating your First Component (JSX, Virtual DOM, render, ReactDOM.render)</h4>\\n<p>First, let’s go ahead and create our very first HelloWorld component so you can\\nvisualize how we use <strong>createClass</strong> to create a component. <strong>createClass</strong>\\ntakes in an object. <strong>This object is what <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> specify the different\\nproperties (render, getInitialState, propTypes) of the component.</strong></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/d5hm5cjL/\\\">Hello World Component Fiddle</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HelloWorld = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        Hello World!\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n\\n\\nReactDOM.render(<span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">HelloWorld</span> /&gt;</span>, document.getElementById('app'));\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>Notice that the only method on the object we’re passing to createClass is the\\n<strong>render</strong> method. Every component is required to have a render method. The\\nreason for that is render is essentially the template for our component. So in\\nthis example the text that will show on the screen where this component is\\nrendered is <strong>Hello World!</strong> A few more things about the code above. We’ve saved\\nthe result of calling our React.createClass constructor into a variable called\\nHelloWorld. We do this because later on we’ll need to tell React to which\\nelement our component should be rendered. This is where ReactDOM.render comes\\ninto play. ReactDOM.render takes in two arguments. The first argument is the\\ncomponent you want to render, the second argument is the DOM node where you want\\nto render the component. <em>(Notice we’re using ReactDOM.render and not\\nReact.render. This was a change made in React .14 to make React more modular. It\\nmakes sense when you think that React can render to more things than just a DOM\\nelement).</em> In the example above we’re telling React to take our <strong>HelloWorld</strong>\\ncomponent and render it to the element with an ID of app. Because of the\\nparent/child child relations of React we talked about earlier, you usually only\\nhave to use ReactDOM.render once in your application because by rendering the\\nmost parent component, all child components will be rendered as well. If you\\nwant your whole app to be React, you would render the component to\\ndocument.body.</p>\\n<p>Now at this point you might feel a little weird throwing “HTML” into your\\nJavaScript. Since you started learning web development, you’ve been told that\\nyou should keep your logic out of the view, AKA keep your JavaScript uncoupled\\nfrom your HTML. This paradigm is strong, but it does have some weaknesses. I\\ndon’t want to make this tutorial longer trying to convince you that this idea is\\na step in the right direction, so if this idea still bothers you you can check\\nout <a href=\\\"http://www.slideshare.net/floydophone/react-preso-v2\\\">this link</a>. As you\\nlearn more about React, this uneasiness should quickly subside. The “HTML” that\\nyou’re writing in the render method isn’t actually HTML but it’s what React is\\ncalling “JSX”. JSX simply allows us to write HTML like syntax which gets\\ntransformed to lightweight JavaScript objects. React is then able to take these\\nJavaScript objects and from them form a “virtual DOM” or a JavaScript\\nrepresentation of the actual DOM. This creates a win/win situation where you get\\nthe accessibility of templates with the power of JavaScript.</p>\\n<p>Looking at the example below, this is what your JSX is transformed to once React\\nruns its transformation process.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/y1qvspm1/\\\">Hello World Component in JS</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HelloWorld = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">displayName</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"HelloMessage\\\"</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> React.createElement(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"div\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Hello World\\\"</span>);\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now, you can forgo the JSX -&gt; JS transform phase and write your React components\\nlike the code above, but as you can imagine, that would be rather tricky. I’m\\nunaware of anyone who is not using JSX.</p>\\n<p>Up until this point we haven’t really emphasized the importance of this new\\nvirtual DOM paradigm we’re jumping into. The reason the React team went with\\nthis approach is because, since the virtual DOM is a JavaScript representation\\nof the actual DOM, React can keep track of the difference between the current\\nvirtual DOM(computed after some data changes), with the previous virtual DOM\\n(computed befores some data changes). <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DX3vJiqxm4\\\">React then isolates the changes between\\nthe old and new virtual DOM and then only updates the real DOM with the\\nnecessary\\nchanges</a><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DX3vJiqxm4\\\">.</a>\\nIn more layman’s terms, because manipulating the actual DOM is slow, React is\\nable to minimize manipulations to the actual DOM by keeping track of a virtual\\nDOM and only updating the real DOM when necessary and with only the necessary\\nchanges. (<a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DX3vJiqxm4\\\">More info here</a>).\\nTypically UI’s have lots of state which makes managing state difficult. By\\nre-rendering the virtual DOM every time any state change occurs, React makes it\\neasier to think about what state your application is in.</p>\\n<p>The process looks something like this,</p>\\n<p><strong>Signal to notify our app some data has changed→ Re-render virtual DOM -&gt; Diff\\nprevious virtual <strong><strong>DOM</strong></strong> with new virtual DOM -&gt; Only update real DOM with\\nnecessary changes.</strong></p>\\n<p>Because there’s this transformation process from JSX to JS, you need to set up\\nsome sort of transformation phase as you’re developing. In part 2 of this series\\nI’ll introduce using Gulp withReact and how to have your Gulp process include\\nthis JSX to JS transformation and more. For now, we’ll just stick with JSFiddle.\\nIf you’re interested in getting started without Gulp, check out the getting\\nstart guide <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>Let’s take a look back at our “Most Important Parts of React” checklist and see\\nwhere we’re at now.</p>\\n<p><strong>JSX — Allows us to write HTML like syntax which gets transformed to lightweight\\nJavaScript objects.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Virtual DOM — A JavaScript representation of the actual\\nDOM.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>React.createClass — The way in which you create a new component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>render (method) — What we would like our HTML Template to look like.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>ReactDOM.render — Renders a React component to a DOM node.</strong></p>\\n<p>state — The internal data store (object) of a component.</p>\\n<p>getInitialState — The way in which you set the initial state of a component.</p>\\n<p>setState — A helper method for altering the state of a component.</p>\\n<p>props — The data which is passed to the child component from the parent component.</p>\\n<p>propTypes — Allows you to control the presence, or types of certain props passed to the child component.</p>\\n<p>getDefaultProps — Allows you to set default props for your component.</p>\\n<p>Component LifeCycle</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>componentWillMount — Fired before the component will mount</li>\\n<li>componentDidMount — Fired after the component mounted</li>\\n<li>componentWillReceiveProps — Fired whenever there is a change to props</li>\\n<li>componentWillUnmount — Fired before the component will unmount</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Events</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>onClick</li>\\n<li>onSubmit</li>\\n<li>onChange</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>We’re making good pace. Everything in bold is what we’ve already covered and you\\nshould at least be able to explain how those certain components fit into the\\nReact ecosystem.</p>\\n<p><strong>Adding State to your Component (state)</strong></p>\\n<p>Next on the list is “state”. Earlier we talked about how managing user\\ninterfaces is difficult because they typically have lots of different states.\\nThis area is where React really starts to shine. Each component has the ability\\nto manage its own state and pass its state down to child components if needed.\\nGoing back to the Twitter example from earlier, the UserInfo component\\n(highlighted in pink above) is responsible for managing the state (or data) of\\nthe users information. If another component also needed this state/data but that\\nstate wasn’t a direct child of the UserInfo component, then you would create\\nanother component that would be the direct parent of the UserInfo and the other\\ncomponent (or both components which required that state), then you would pass\\nthe state down as props into the child components. In other words, if you have a\\nmulti component hierarchy, a common parent component should manage the state and\\npass it down to its children components via props.</p>\\n<p>Let’s take a look at an example component using it’s own internal state.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/du72b5L2/\\\">Hello {name} With State</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HelloUser = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">username</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@tylermcginnis33'</span>\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        Hello {this.state.username}\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’ve introduced some new syntax with this example. The first one you’ll notice\\nis the getInitialState method. From the definition above, the getInitialState\\nmethod is “The way in which you set the state of a component”. In other terms,\\ngetInitialState returns an object which contains the state or data for our\\n<a href=\\\"http://component.In\\\">component.In</a> the code above we’re telling our component that we want it to keep\\ntrack of a username. This username can now be used inside our component by\\n<strong>{this.state.username}</strong>, which is exactly what we do in our render method.</p>\\n<p>The last thing to talk about with state is that our component needs the ability\\nto modify its own internal state. We do this with a method called <strong>setState</strong>.\\nRemember earlier when we talked about the re-rendering of the virtual dom\\nwhenever the data changes?</p>\\n<p><strong>Signal to notify our app some data has changed→ Re-render virtual DOM -&gt; Diff\\nprevious virtual DOM with new virtual DOM -&gt; Only update real DOM with necessary\\nchanges.</strong></p>\\n<p>That “signal to notify our app some data has changed” is actually just setState.\\nWhenever setState is called, the virtual DOM re-renders, the diff algorithm\\nruns, and the real DOM is updated with the necessary changes.</p>\\n<p>As a sidenote, when we introduce setState in the code below, we’re also going to\\nintroduce a few events that are on our list. Two birds, one stone.</p>\\n<p>So in the next code sample, we’re going to now have an input box that whenever\\nsomeone types into it, it will automatically update our state and change the\\nusername.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/f27qby3L/\\\">Hello {name} with Ability to Change State\\nFiddle</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HelloUser = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">username</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@tylermcginnis33'</span>\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">handleChange</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">e</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.setState({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">username</span>: e.target.value\\n    });\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        Hello {this.state.username} <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">br</span> /&gt;</span>\\n        Change Name: <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">input</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"text\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">value</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{this.state.username}</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onChange</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{this.handleChange}</span> /&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>Note we’ve introduced a few more things. The first thing is the <strong>handleChange</strong>\\nmethod. This method is going to get called every time a user types in the input\\nbox. When handleChange is called, it’s going to call setState to re-define our\\nusername withwhatever was typed into the input box (e.target.value). Remember,\\nwhenever setState is called, React creates a new virtual DOM, does the diff,\\nthen updates the real DOM.</p>\\n<p>Now let’s look at our render method. We’ve added a new line that contains an\\ninput field. The type of the input field is obviously going to be “text”. The\\nvalue is going to be the value of our username which was originally defined in\\nour getInitialState method and will be updated in the handleChange method.\\nNotice there is a new attribute you’ve probably never seen before, <strong>onChange</strong>.\\nonChange is a React thing and it will call whatever method you specify every\\ntime the value in the input box changes, in this case the method we specified\\nwas handleChange.</p>\\n<p>The process for the code above would go something like this.</p>\\n<p>A user types into the input box → handleChange is invoked → the state of our\\ncomponent is set to a new value → React re-renders the virtual DOM → React Diffs\\nthe change → Real DOM is updated.</p>\\n<p>Later on when we cover props, we’ll see some more advanced use cases of handling\\nstate.</p>\\n<p>We’re getting there! If you can’t explain the items in bold below, go re-read\\nthat section. *and one tip on REALLY learning React. Don’t let passively reading\\nthis give you a false sense of security that you actually know what’s going on\\nand can re-create what we’re doing. Head over to JSfiddle and try to recreate\\n(or create your own) components without looking at what I’ve done. It’s the only\\nway you’ll truly start learning how to build with React. This goes for this\\ntutorial and the following to come.</p>\\n<p><strong>JSX — Allows us to write HTML like syntax which gets transformed to lightweight\\nJavaScript objects.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Virtual DOM — A JavaScript representation of the actual\\nDOM.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>React.createClass — The way in which you create a new component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>render (method) — What we would like our HTML Template to look like.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>ReactDOM.render — Renders a React component to a DOM node.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>state — The internal data store (object) of a component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>getInitialState — The way in which you set the initial state of a component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>setState — A helper method for altering the state of a component.</strong></p>\\n<p>props — The data which is passed to the child component from the parent component.</p>\\n<p>propTypes — Allows you to control the presence, or types of certain props passed to the child component.</p>\\n<p>getDefaultProps — Allows you to set default props for your component.</p>\\n<p>Component LifeCycle</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>componentWillMount — Fired before the component will mount</li>\\n<li>componentDidMount — Fired after the component mounted</li>\\n<li>componentWillReceiveProps — Fired whenever there is a change to props</li>\\n<li>componentWillUnmount — Fired before the component will unmount</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Events</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>onClick</li>\\n<li>onSubmit</li>\\n<li>onChange</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Receiving State from Parent Component (props, propTypes, getDefaultProps)</strong></p>\\n<p>We’ve talked about props a few times already since it’s hard to really do much\\nwithout them. By our definition above, props is the data which is passed to the\\nchild component from the parent component. This allows for our React\\narchitecture to stay pretty straight forward. Handle state in the highest most\\nparent component which needs to use the specific data, and if you have a child\\ncomponent that also needs that data, pass that data down as props.</p>\\n<p>Here’s a very basic example of using props.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/jsd0qa3u/\\\">Very Basic Props Example</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HelloUser = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span> Hello, {this.props.name}<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n\\nReactDOM.render(<span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">HelloUser</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Tyler\\\"</span>/&gt;</span>, document.getElementById('app'));\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>Notice on line 9 we have an attribute called name with a value of “Tyler”. Now\\nin our component, we can use <strong>{<a href=\\\"http://this.props.name\\\">this.props.name</a>}</strong> to get “Tyler”.</p>\\n<p>Let’s look at a more advanced example. We’re going to have two components now.\\nOne parent, one child. The parent is going to keep track of the state and pass a\\npart of that state down to the child as props. Let’s first take a look at that\\nparent component.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/xbq2dxut/\\\">Passing a list to a Child\\nComponent</a></p>\\n<p>Parent Component:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> FriendsContainer = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler McGinnis'</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">friends</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Jake Lingwall'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Murphy Randall'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Merrick Christensen'</span>]\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">h3</span>&gt;</span> Name: {this.state.name} <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">h3</span>&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">ShowList</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">names</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{this.state.friends}</span> /&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>There really isn’t much going on in this component that we haven’t seen before.\\nWe have an initial state and we pass part of that initial state to another\\ncomponent. The majority of the new code will come from this child component so\\nlet’s take a closer look at that.</p>\\n<p>Child Component:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> ShowList = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> listItems = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.props.names.map(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">friend</span>)</span>{\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">li</span>&gt;</span> {friend} <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">li</span>&gt;</span></span>;\\n    });\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">h3</span>&gt;</span> Friends <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">h3</span>&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">ul</span>&gt;</span>\\n          {listItems}\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">ul</span>&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Remember that the code that gets returned from our render method is a\\nrepresentation of what the real DOM should look like. If you’re not familiar\\nwith <strong>Array.prototype.map</strong>, this code might look a little wonky. All map does\\nis it creates a new array, calls our callback function on each item in the\\narray, and fills the new array with the result of calling the callback function\\non each item. For example,</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/xgwpzv80/\\\">Array.prototype.map</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> friends = [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Jake Lingwall'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Murphy Randall'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Merrick Christensen'</span>];\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> listItems = friends.map(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">friend</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"&lt;li&gt; \\\"</span> + friend + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"&lt;/li&gt;\\\"</span>;\\n});\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(listItems); <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// [\\\"&lt;li&gt; Jake Lingwall&lt;/li&gt;\\\", \\\"&lt;li&gt; Murphy Randall&lt;/li&gt;\\\", \\\"&lt;li&gt; Merrick Christensen&lt;/li&gt;\\\"];</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The console.log above returns <code>[&quot;&lt;li&gt; Jake Lingwall&lt;/li&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;li&gt; Murphy Randall&lt;/li&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;li&gt; Merrick Christensen&lt;/li&gt;&quot;]</code>.</p>\\n<p>Notice all that happened was we\\nmade a new array and added <code>&lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt;</code> to each item in the original array.</p>\\n<p>What’s great about map is it fits perfectly into React (and it’s built into\\nJavaScript). So in our child component above, we’re mapping over names, wrapping\\neach name in a pair of <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags, and saving that to our listItems variable.\\nThen, our render method returns an unordered list with all of our friends.</p>\\n<p>Let’s look at one more example before we stop talking about props. It’s\\nimportant to understand that wherever the data lives, is the exact place you\\nwant to manipulate that data. This keeps it simple to reason about your data.\\nAll getter/setter method for a certain piece of data will always be in the same\\ncomponent where that data was defined. If you needed to manipulate some piece of\\ndata outside where the data lives, you’d pass the getter/setter method into that\\ncomponent as props. Let’s take a look at an example like that.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/6rhdpt5c/\\\">Passing a List to a Child Component with a Setter\\nMethod</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> FriendsContainer = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler McGinnis'</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">friends</span>: [\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Jake Lingwall'</span>,\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Murphy Randall'</span>,\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Merrick Christensen'</span>\\n      ],\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">addFriend</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">friend</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.setState({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">friends</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.state.friends.concat([friend])\\n    });\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      &lt;div&gt;\\n        &lt;h3&gt;

Notice how I created\\na new AddFriend component that manages the new friend we’re going to add. The\\nreason for this is because the parent component (FriendContainer) doesn’t care\\nabout the new friend you’re adding, it only cares about all of your friends as a\\nwhole (the friends array). However, because we’re sticking with the rule of only\\nmanipulate your data from the component that cares about it, we’ve passed the\\naddFriend method down into our AddFriend component as a propand we call it with\\nthe new friend once the handleAddNew method is called.</p>\\n<p>At this point I recommend you try to recreate this same functionality on your\\nown using the code above as a guidance once you’ve been stuck for 3-4 minutes.</p>\\n<p>Before we move on from props, I want to cover two more React features regarding\\nprops.

Or, if we wanted to run some\\nlogic whenever our props changed, how would we do that? The different lifecycle\\nevents are the answers to both of those.

If you were to\\ncall setState here, no re-render would be invoked. An example of this would be\\nif you’re using a service like firebase, you’d set up your reference to your\\nfirebase database here since it’s only invoked once on the initial render.</p>\\n<p><strong>componentDidMount</strong> - Invoked once after the initial render. Because the\\ncomponent has already been invoked when this method is invoked, you have access\\nto the virtual DOM if you need it. You do that by calling\\n<strong>this.getDOMNode()</strong>. <em>Now it might seem like if you wanted to make AJAX\\nrequests you would do that in componentWillMount, but the devs at facebook\\nactually recommend you do that in componentDidMount. So this is the lifecycle\\nevent where you’ll be making your AJAX requests to fetch some data.</em></p>\\n<p><strong>componentWillReceiveProps</strong> - This life cycle is not called on the initial\\nrender, but is instead called whenever there is a change to props. Use this\\nmethod as a way to react to a prop change before render() is called by updating\\nthe state with setState.</p>\\n<p><strong>componentWillUnmount</strong> - This life cycle is invoked immediately before a\\ncomponent is unmounted from the DOM. This is where you can do necessary clean\\nup. For example, going back to our firebase example this is the life cycle event\\nwhere you would clean up your firebase reference you set in componentWillMount.</p>\\n<p>There are a <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html\\\">few\\nmore</a> life cycle\\nmethods, but the ones I’ve covered are the ones that I’ve seen which are the\\nmost useful.</p>\\n<p>Well, if you stuck with me until this point, great job. I hope this tutorial was\\nbeneficial to you and you now feel at least mildly comfortable with React. As I\\nmentioned before, this is just part 1 of a 6 part tutorial series.

This tutorial is going to\\nintroduce Gulp as a way to transform JSX into JS (along with a few other handy\\ntransformations). It’s also going to cover using Browserify with React in order\\nto be able to import/export components for the use in other components.</p>\\n<p><em>I realize that there are many other ways to do the JSX -&gt; JS transformation\\nand specifically a lot of people are using webpack for mostly all of this. Those\\nother ways are great. I’ve found that for beginners though, Gulp and Browserify\\nmake a great pair which abstracts some low level complexities without\\nabstracting everything. I hope to build a future tutorial which uses Webpack\\ninstead of Gulp/Browserify.</em></p>\\n<p>Let’s start with Gulp. If you’ve had experience with another build tool, such as\\nGrunt or Broccoli, this will make a lot of sense. If you have no experience with\\nbuild tools, this next section is more specifically for you.</p>\\n<p>Let’s talk about why we need a tool like Gulp. Think of all the cool tools\\ndevelopers have built on top of things like JavaScript and CSS. Let’s use SASS\\nand Coffeescript as examples. One day this (or perhaps these) developers got\\ntogether and they said something along the lines of “Hey, CSS is cool, but it\\nhas a lot of limitations. Let’s make a language that is a layer on top of CSS.\\nWhat we can do is we can create a language that is more powerful than CSS and\\nhas a lot more features. Then all we have to do is figure out a way for our\\nlanguage to have some sort of process to it which allows developers using our\\nlanguage to convert it (or transpile it) to actual CSS so the browser can\\nunderstand it.” — and that’s exactly what they did. Coffeescript is another\\nexample. That conversation probably went like this “Wow JavaScript is so ugly.\\nThere’s not even a class keyword. We should build a language that isn’t so ugly\\nand then figure out how to transpile it to actual JavaScript because that’s all\\nthe browser can understand.” A conversation similar to this most likely occurred\\nwhen the React team decided to go with this JSX idea. As long as there’s a way\\nto convert the “transpiled language” to a real language the browser can\\nunderstand, there’s no issue. One convenient use case for Gulp is that we can\\ntell Gulp that whenever we change a certain file or whenever we do some certain\\nevent, to go ahead and take our Coffeescript, SASS, JSX (etc), and transpile it\\ninto actual JavaScript or CSS.</p>\\n<p>Though having Gulp transpile your code is great, if you were only doing that,\\nyou probably don’t need the power of Gulp since there are more basic solutions.\\nHowever, we’re going to use Gulp for more than just transpiling our JSX into JS.\\nLet’s think of some more things we do as developers that could be automated with\\na build tool process like Gulp. Perhaps the most obvious processes are the ones\\nwe use right before pushing our code to production. We first minify our code\\n(shorten variable names, remove white space, etc) in order to minimize our file\\nsize. Next thing we usually do is concatenate all of our JavaScript files into\\none file so when the client makes a request to the server for our app, it can\\ngrab that one concatenated JavaScript file without having to worry about making\\na bunch of requests to grab all of the files. Next thing you would need to do is\\nhead over to your HTML page and change out all your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags with just one,\\nwhich was the minified JavaScript file. There are a plethora of things you can\\ndo with Gulp, we’ll stick with the most common ones for this post.</p>\\n<p>Now that you have a better idea of why build tools like Gulp are so handy, let’s\\njump into getting started with Gulp.</p>\\n<p>The first thing you need to do when starting out with Gulp is to use NPM to\\ninstall Gulp globally. If you’re not familiar with NPM, download Node and then\\ndo some googling. Using NPM is outside of the scope of this tutorial but is\\nfairly straight forward.</p>\\n<p>In your terminal run</p>\\n<pre><code>npm install --global gulp\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>that will install gulp globally on your computer.</p>\\n<p>Now, go ahead and make a new project with a folder structure that looks like\\nthis (remember, passively reading this tutorial won’t get you very far).</p>\\n<pre><code>gulpfile.js\\nsrc\\n  index.html\\n  js\\n    App.js\\n    Child.js\\n    Parent.js\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Head over to your <em>index.html</em> page and add the following code.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">html</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">head</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">head</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">body</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">id</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"app\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.12.2/react.min.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"src/Child.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"src/Parent.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"src/App.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">body</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">html</span>&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Notice it’s pretty bare right now. All we really have is a div with an id of app\\nand we’re loading React from a CDN.</p>\\n<p>Head over to your* Child.js* file and add the following code.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Child = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        and this is the <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">b</span>&gt;</span>{this.props.name}<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">b</span>&gt;</span>.\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>One more boilerplate addition. Now head over to your Parent.js file and add the\\nfollowing code.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Parent = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span> This is the parent. <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Child</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"child\\\"</span>/&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>Now head over to your <em>App.js</em> file and add the following code.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">React.render(<span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Parent</span> /&gt;</span>, document.getElementById('app'));\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>Notice all we’re doing is creating two components, one child, one parent. The\\nparent component is rendered to <em>#app</em> (in <em>App.js</em>), which then renders the\\nchild component passing in “child” as a property on props.</p>\\n<p>Now comes the fun part. Let’s head over to our <em>gulpfile.js</em> file and start\\nbuilding out our build process. Here’s the functionality that we eventually want\\nfrom our final gulp build process.</p>\\n<p>Development</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Transform our JSX into JS and save the output into a dist/src folder.</li>\\n<li>Copy our index.html from our src folder into the dist folder</li>\\n<li>Watch changes to any JS or HTML file then run the previous two processes again.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Production</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Take all the JS files, concat them all together, minify the result, then output\\nthe result to one file named build.js to the build folder inside the dist\\nfolder</li>\\n<li>Replace our <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags in our index.html page with one <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>\\nwhich references our new minified build.js file</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>With these processes above we’ll make it very simple to prepare our code for\\nproduction and also very simple to convert our JSX to JS during development.</p>\\n<h4><strong>Download NPM Packages</strong></h4>\\n<p>The very first thing we need to do is set up our package.json file. For those\\nunfamiliar with what our package.json is for, it’s essentially just a collection\\nof the node packages that are required for our application. In your terminal,\\nhead over to the root of this project then type **npm init **and select from the\\ndifferent options (you can just hit enter until it finishes). The options don’t\\nmatter too much - you can change them later.</p>\\n<p>Once you’re finished with that you’ll have a bare package.json file. Now in your\\nterminal run the following commands.</p>\\n<pre><code>npm install --save-dev gulp;\\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-concat;\\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-uglify;\\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-react;\\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-html-replace;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>If you’ve used npm before, this is pretty straight forward. If you haven’t, we\\npractically just did witchcraft. All we did was tell npm to go and download each\\nof those packages and save them into our <em>node_modules</em> folder (which was\\ncreated for us) and add them to our <em>package.json</em> file as a developer\\ndependency. Now if you check out the <em>node_modules</em> folder, it should be full of\\nthe packages above. What we can do now is in our <em>gulpfile.js</em> file, we can use\\n<strong>require</strong> to essentially import the code from each of the different packages\\nand save that functionality into a variable. Let’s do that right now.</p>\\n<p>In the top of your <em>gulpfile.js</em> file, add the following code.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> gulp = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> concat = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-concat'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> uglify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-uglify'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> react = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-react'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> htmlreplace = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-html-replace'</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Notice we’ve created a variable for each of the packages we downloaded earlier.\\nNow, each of those variables is just whatever was being exported from each\\nindividual package.</p>\\n<p>Before we dive into building our different Gulp tasks, we first need to create a\\npaths object. This paths object is going to be filled with properties that\\nrepresent differents paths. Copy this code under your variable declarations in\\nour <em>gulpfile.js</em> file.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> path = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">HTML</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">ALL</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/js/*.js'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/js/**/*.js'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/index.html'</span>],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">JS</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/js/*.js'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/js/**/*.js'</span>],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">MINIFIED_OUT</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build.min.js'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST_SRC</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist/src'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST_BUILD</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist/build'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist'</span>\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now that are paths are defined, let’s create our first gulp task.</p>\\n<h4><strong>Gulp Tasks for Development</strong></h4>\\n<p>Our first task is going to be called transform and it’s going to be what\\ntransforms our JSX into JS. The code for this task looks like this,</p>\\n<pre><code>gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'transform'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span></span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.JS)\\n    .pipe(react())\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST_SRC));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Perhaps the coolest thing about Gulp is its ability to pipe and chain function\\ninvocations. What this means is that we’re able to take one file, transform it\\nand do something with it, then take that transformation and do something else\\nwith it, then when we’re finished, tell it where to put the newly created file.\\nThat’s exactly what we’re doing above. We create a gulp task called transform\\nand pass it a callback function. In our callback function we grab the <em>path.JS\\narray</em>. Gulp then gets each one of those files, transforms them using the react\\nmethod we initialized earlier then pipes that outcome to <em>dist/src</em>. If you ran\\nthis task, after you’d see that Gulp took all your JS files, converted your JSX\\nto JS, then outputted the results to a new <em>src</em> folder in a new <em>dist</em> folder -\\nall in a manner of milliseconds. Pretty rad.</p>\\n<p>Let’s create our next Gulp task. All this task is going to do is take our\\n<em>index.html</em> file and copy it over to our <em>dist</em> folder so our newly created JS\\nfiles from our transform Gulp task above can be referenced by our <em>index.html</em>\\npage.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'copy'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.HTML)\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’re now going to create our last Gulp task for development. What we want to do\\nis create a task that will always be running so when we change either our\\n<em>index.html</em> or any of the JS files, our two tasks from earlier will run and\\nupdate the code in the <em>dist</em> folder.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'watch'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.watch(path.ALL, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'transform'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'copy'</span>]);\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>What the task above is saying is watch all of our files, whenever any of them\\nchange, run the transform task and the copy task. Pretty straightforward.</p>\\n<p>Now all we want to do for our development tasks is set up a default task. This\\ndefault task will run whenever we type <strong>gulp</strong> in our command line. Here’s the\\ncode for that.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'default'</span>, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'watch'</span>]);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>When we type <strong>gulp</strong>, Gulp will run the watch task, which we know watches our\\nfiles for changes and then runs the <strong>transform</strong> and <strong>copy</strong> tasks.</p>\\n<p>Those are all the tasks we’re going to create for developing. There are\\nobviously a plethora of other tasks you could create for dev, but those are what\\nwe’ll stick with right now. At this point you should be able to run <strong>gulp</strong> and\\nthe JSX in your <em>App.js</em> file will be converted to JS and the output will go to\\n<em>dist/src.</em> Your index.html file should have also been copied over to your dist\\nfolder. Open your <em>index.html</em> page in the browser and you should see your\\ncomponents being rendered.</p>\\n<p><strong>Production Gulp Tasks</strong></p>\\n<p>Now what we want to do is create a few gulp tasks for production so whenever we\\nrun <strong>gulp build</strong> our code will prepare itself to get pushed to production.</p>\\n<p>The first task we’re going to build for production is called <strong>build</strong>. This\\ntask is going to grab all of our JS files, concatenate all of them together,\\nminify them, then output the result to our <em>dist/build</em> folder. The code for\\nthat looks like this.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.JS)\\n    .pipe(react())\\n    .pipe(concat(path.MINIFIED_OUT))\\n    .pipe(uglify(path.MINIFIED_OUT))\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST_BUILD));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The only thing that might look a little strange is the <em>path.OUT</em> argument we’re\\npassing to concat and uglify. All this is doing is telling both of those\\nfunctions what the resulting file path should be, so in this case, when we use\\ngulp.dest it’s going to take the <em>path.MINIFIED_OUT</em> file (<em>build.min.js</em>) and\\noutput it to <em>path.DEST_BUILD</em> (<em>dist/build</em>).</p>\\n<p>Now you might notice this is cool, but at this point it’s a little annoying\\nbecause whenever we run <strong>gulp build</strong>, we then need to go and change our HTML\\nto reference the new <em>build.min.js</em> file rather than <em>src/App.js</em> and whatever\\nother script tags we’re referencing here. What if there were a way to, whenever\\nwe ran our production gulp tasks, to replace all of our <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags with just\\nour new <code>&lt;script src=”build/build.mins.js”&gt;</code> script and then output that new\\nfile to our dist folder? Well, there is. The way we’re going to do that is with\\na <strong>gulp-html-replace</strong>. First, we need to head over to our index.html in our\\nmain src folder and make some additions.

As you’re doing that go to my copied <em>index.html</em> page in my <em>dist</em>\\nfolder and replace the <strong>build:js</strong> comment and whatever is inside of it with\\nthis new script tag <code>&lt;script src=&quot;build/build.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> but don’t\\nchange my original <em>index.html</em> file in my normal <em>src</em> folder because I still\\nwant to develop with that.”</p>\\n<p>Let’s now build out our replaceHTML task.

That ‘js’ key in htmlreplace\\ncoincides with** build:js** in our <em>index.html</em> page.</p>\\n<p>Very last step is now that both of our production tasks are ready, we need to\\ncreate another task that wraps both of those tasks in one.

As you might\\nhave noticed, this method has some weaknesses. First, you have to be very\\ncareful how you load your different components in your HTML. Notice that we’re\\nloading the <em>Child.js</em> file before the <em>Parent.js</em> file. This makes sense\\nbecause <em>Parent.js</em> is dependent upon <em>Child.js</em>. Also note how we’re loading\\n<em>Parent.js</em> before we load <em>App.js</em>, again this is because Parent is required in\\nthe <em>App.js</em> file. It might seem pretty straight forward in this example but as\\nyour app grows, it’s very tricky to keep track of these Parent/Child\\nrelationships and not to mention both Child and Parent are now in the global\\nscope, which from CS 101 we know is not a good thing. Another weakness in this\\nmethod is that if you put a debugger in our JSX, by the time our browser loads\\nthat debugger we’re no longer in JSX land but in JS land and we have no way of\\ntelling which line the error is on in our original JSX code. This isn’t ideal.\\nAlthough we still will always have to debug our transpiled JSX version, it would\\nbe neat if we were able to still get the line numbers of where the error was at\\nin our original JSX file. Good news is when we introduce Browserify into our\\nbuild process, it will take care of both of these weaknesses and more.</p>\\n<p>At a fundamental level, all <a href=\\\"http://browserify.org/\\\">Browserify</a> allows you to\\ndo is require certain packages just like we did earlier with gulp, concat,\\nuglify, etc. This has huge benefits for us because not only do we now have\\naccess to all of NPMs packages, but we’re now able to require only the packages\\n(or React components) we need to for that specific file. This solves our problem\\nof all of our components being on the global scope. Let’s take a quick look at\\nexporting and requiring modules.</p>\\n<p>I remember when I first started leaning about Browserify every definition about\\nit would be in terms of commonjs - which meant literally nothing to me because I\\nknew nothing about commonjs. That is until I fell upon\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2e0161/eli5_amd_commonjs_es6/\\\">this</a>\\narticle on Reddit. The author talks about how Commonjs, AMD, and ES6 Modules are\\nall ways to “break a Javascript project up into multiple self-contained modules\\nand managing the dependencies between them”. That makes sense. I can essentially\\ncreate module that can be passed around and used in other parts of my\\napplication without having to pollute the global scope. The author continues,\\n“CommonJS is the standard implemented by Node. A file can assign any value\\n(including a function or object) to its module.exports property and any other\\nfile can use require(“filename”) to get a copy of that value. It works great in\\nNode but isn’t usable in a web browser; because of a quirk of the way file\\nloading in HTML and Javascript works fetching each of the files would cause the\\nbrowser to hang until it was loaded. There are, however, some tools (browserify)\\nthat will let you write your browser code in CommonJS and automatically convert\\nit to something web appropriate.” Then it clicked. All Browserify allows me to\\ndo is have the greatness of using require in Node, but on the browser. This is\\nfantastic for React because as you’ve probably guessed by now, each React\\ncomponent we create can be its own module that we can then require in other\\ncomponents based off of need. Let’s take a look at some sample commonjs syntax.</p>\\n<p>We’re going to create three files (<strong><em>NOTE: This example (Add, Multiply, Math)\\nis just for demonstrating how Commonjs works, it’s not part of the overall\\ntutorial</em></strong>). The first file will be called <em>Add.js</em> and it will export an\\nobject with an addition helper method on it. The second file will be called\\n<em>Multiply.js</em> and it will export an object with a multiplication helper method\\non it. The third will be called <em>Math.js</em> where we require and then use our Add\\nand Multiply module.</p>\\n<p><strong>Add.js file</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> addObj  = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">add</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">x,y</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> x + y;\\n  }\\n};\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = addObj;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Multply.js file</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> multiplyObj = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">multiply</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">x,y</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> x * y;\\n  }\\n};\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = multiplyObj;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Math.js file</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> addObj = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(‘./Add’);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> multplyObj = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(‘./Multiply’);\\n\\naddObj.add(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">3</span>,<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">4</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 7</span>\\nmultiplyObj.multiply(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>,<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">5</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 10</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Just a few minor things to note about the code above. If you want a certain\\nobject or function to be available in a different file, you use module.exports\\nto export your code.</p>\\n<p>If you want to require whatever was exported from a different file, you use\\nrequire and whatever the name of that file was minus the extension.</p>\\n<p>Now that we have a solid understanding of how Browserify can make our React code\\nmore modular, let’s view the bigger picture of what our build process will look\\nlike when we incorporate browserify. We’re still going to have two main tasks,\\n<strong>watch</strong> and <strong>build</strong>. <strong>watch</strong> for development and <strong>build</strong> for production.\\nOn the surface both of these tasks will look very similar to our tasks before we\\nadded Browserify. Our <strong>watch</strong> task is going to concat our JS files, transform\\nthem from JSX to JS, and output the results into our <em>dist</em> folder. <strong>build</strong>\\nwill also transform our JSX to JS, concatenate, minify, then output the result\\nto out <em>dist</em> folder. The process looks similar, but there are actually some\\nreally cool features introduced by Browserify which we haven’t talked about.\\nWe’ll get those more when we look at the code.</p>\\n<p>Let’s jump in.</p>\\n<p><strong>Browserify + Gulp + React (Development Tasks)</strong></p>\\n<p>Like before, we’re going to start out downloading all of the NPM packages we’ll\\nneed for our new gulpfile. However, before we jump into that let’s hurry and\\nremove an NPM package we were using for the previous example that we won’t be\\nusing for this example. In your terminal run</p>\\n<pre><code>npm uninstall gulp-concat;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This commands remove the Concat libraries from our <em>package.json</em> and our\\n<em>node_modules</em> folder.</p>\\n<p>Now let’s install the new NPM packages we will need. Run the following command\\nin your terminal.</p>\\n<pre><code>npm install --save-dev vinyl-source-stream;\\nnpm install --save-dev browserify;\\nnpm install --save-dev watchify;\\nnpm install --save-dev reactify;\\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-streamify;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’ll get into what each of these packages do when we use them in our tasks.\\nHead over to your <em>gulpfile.js</em> and go ahead and remove everything. It’s easier\\nto start new since we’re introducing a pretty big change with browserify. At the\\ntop of your gulpfile add the following code like we did before.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> gulp = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> uglify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-uglify'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> htmlreplace = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-html-replace'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> source = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'vinyl-source-stream'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> browserify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'browserify'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> watchify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'watchify'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> reactify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'reactify'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> streamify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-streamify'</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> path = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">HTML</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">MINIFIED_OUT</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build.min.js'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">OUT</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build.js'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST_BUILD</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist/build'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST_SRC</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist/src'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">ENTRY_POINT</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./src/js/App.js'</span>\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The first task we’re going to create is our copy task. This is exactly the same\\nas before.

This one is pretty\\nlengthy so I’ll post the code and we’ll walk through it.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'watch'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  gulp.watch(path.HTML, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'copy'</span>]);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> watcher  = watchify(browserify({\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entries</span>: [path.ENTRY_POINT],\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">transform</span>: [reactify],\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">debug</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">true</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">cache</span>: {}, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">packageCache</span>: {}, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">fullPaths</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">true</span>\\n  }));\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> watcher.on(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'update'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    watcher.bundle()\\n      .pipe(source(path.OUT))\\n      .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST_SRC))\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Updated'</span>);\\n  })\\n    .bundle()\\n    .pipe(source(path.OUT))\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST_SRC));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The very first thing we do is tell Gulp to watch our <em>index.html</em> file for any\\nchanges and if something does change, run the copy task.</p>\\n<p>The next thing we do is set up a watcher. Watchify works very closely with\\nBrowserify. A problem that was occurring with these Browserify/React build\\nprocesses was that Browserify would take forever to transpile because it was\\ngoing through every component every single time anything changed and would\\nre-update the new bundled file. Watchify fixes this. Instead of going through\\nevery file, Watchify will cache your files and only update the ones that need to\\nbe updated. This makes builds take a LOT less time.</p>\\n<p>Notice we’re passing a browserify function invocation to our watchify function\\ninvocation. Let’s now talk a bit about that browserify invocation. We’re passing\\nbrowserify an object that is going to essentially set up the configurations for\\nour browserify build. The first property on the object is <strong>entries</strong>. Notice\\nentries is an array with the path of just our main component in it (<em>app.js</em>).\\nYou might remember earlier we had a JS array (<em>['src/js/</em>.js’,\\n'src/js/<em><em>/</em>.js’]</em>) which was every JS file we wanted to be transformed from JSX\\nto JS. Well one perk with browserify is that you just tell it the entry point or\\nthe main component in your app and it will take care of all the child\\ncomponents. Pretty slick. Next we have the <strong>transform</strong> property. Browserify\\nworks with more than just React. Here is where we tell Browserify how to\\ntransform our code. In this case, we’re using reactify which will take care of\\nour JSX to JS transpiling. Next is <strong>debug</strong> which is set to true. This tells\\nBrowserify to use source maps. What source maps do is even though we’re\\nreferencing the transpiled JSX in our index.html page, through source maps when\\nthere is an error in our code, the error will point to the line number in our\\nJSX file rather than our transpiled JS file. This is super convenient for\\ndebugging. That last line with <strong>cache: {}, packageCache: {}, fullPaths: true</strong>\\nis necessary, but we won’t go into it. The watchify website just states that\\nit’s needed in order to use watchify.</p>\\n<p>The next thing we’re going to do is set up our watcher to watch for updates in\\nour parent component or in any of its children components. We tell our watcher\\nto watch for updates then we pass it a callback function to invoke whenever\\nthere is an update. The code in the callback should look fairly familiar.\\n**watcher.bundle() **concatenates all of our different components into one file\\nand does some browserify magic to make the module.exports/requires work. Then\\nthe rest is just piping the result to our <em>dist/src</em> folder. The last thing in\\nour watch task is that we’re continuing to bundle and pipe after we set up the\\non update callback. The reason for this is so that when we first call <strong>gulp\\nwatch</strong> our code will bundle and pipe itself to the dist folder even before a\\nchange is made. Then any changes made to our JS files after that will just\\noverwrite the initial bundled code.</p>\\n<p>The last thing for our development tasks is to set the default gulp task to run\\nthe watch task so we can now just run <strong>gulp</strong> and our watch task will kick off.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'default'</span>, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'watch'</span>]);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4><strong>Browserify + Gulp + React (Production Tasks)</strong></h4>\\n<p>Just like before we started using Browserify, I like to keep my Development and\\nProduction tasks separate. Like before, create a gulp task called <strong>build</strong>.\\nThis task is going to be very similar to our <strong>watch</strong> task except this one is\\nonly going to bundle and pipe our code without actually watching it for updates.\\nIt’s also going to minify the final code then output it to <em>dist/build</em> rather\\nthan <em>dist/src</em>.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  browserify({\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entries</span>: [path.ENTRY_POINT],\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">transform</span>: [reactify]\\n  })\\n    .bundle()\\n    .pipe(source(path.MINIFIED_OUT))\\n    .pipe(streamify(uglify(path.MINIFIED_OUT)))\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST_BUILD));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Like I mentioned, this is mostly the same. We got rid of source mapping and our\\nwatchify stuff and added minification, but that’s it.</p>\\n<p>Also exactly like before we used Browserify, we want to be able to modify our\\nindex.html page when it’s ready for production and switch out our regular\\nscripts with the minified versions. We’ll use the same <strong>replaceHTML</strong> task that\\nwe used before to do this.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'replaceHTML'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.HTML)\\n    .pipe(htmlreplace({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'js'</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build/'</span> + path.MINIFIED_OUT\\n    }))\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and to wrap both of our production tasks into one gulp process,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'production'</span>, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'replaceHTML'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build'</span>]);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and that’s it! Here’s what the full <em>gulpfile.js</em> should look like</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> gulp = <span

You’ll then most likely look to Google for the source of that\\nanswer and after a bit of researching softly conclude that, yes you should.\\nHowever, I wish that wasn’t always the answer. Flux is great. Flux does a really\\ngood job at what it’s designed to do. I use Flux. A lot of people use Flux. But\\nyou don’t have to use Flux with React. In fact, I would suggest that you don’t\\neven look at Flux until you really understand the pain point that it’s trying to\\nsolve. Too many people jump into React then jump straight to Flux because they\\nthink they have to and are left disappointed with React because Flux is a bit,\\ncomplex. <strong>Don’t let the complexity of Flux ruin the simplicity of React.</strong></p>\\n<p>So, a better question than “Should I learn Flux?” is “Should I use Flux for this\\nparticular project?” and if yes, then learn it. The entire reasoning behind Flux\\nis making data changes in your app easy to reason about. In its most simple\\nform, Flux removes the burden of having a component manage its own state and\\nmoves that data to a central location called a Store where multiple components\\ncan now share that data. Then, everything in that Store’s purpose is to, in one\\nway or another, assist in the modification or preservation of the data. The\\nbenefit of this is that if the data in the Store changes, you know exactly what\\ntriggered the change because the Store is the only place in your app with the\\nability to modify the data.</p>\\n<p>Notice how Flux revolves around the fact that your application has data and that\\ndata needs to be kept up to date in an effective manner. If your app doesn’t\\nhave and or care about dynamic data, Flux might not be the best choice. Flux\\nexcels in respect to data management, but will feel unnecessary if you don’t\\nhave any data to manage.</p>\\n<p>So now that you’re aware of the necessity of your app to have data in order for\\nFlux to be beneficial, let’s talk about the flow of a Flux app. Because, again,\\nthe whole idea of a Flux app is to make your data changes easy to reason about,\\nFlux embraces a one way data flow architecture. So what we’ll do in this\\ntutorial is we’ll walk through every part of the Flux architecture until we have\\na solid grasp of each concept.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*wb78t7XwxmQHIOW6.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Above is a Flux diagram I made that I wish existed when I was learning Flux. It\\nwon’t make a ton of sense now, but as you read through the different parts of\\nthe Flux architecture my hope is that you’ll reference this diagram and it will\\nstart clicking for you. <strong>If you’ve read any of my tutorials before, you know\\nI’m a huge fan of trying to break things down into their most easy to understand\\nform. With Flux, I can honestly say this was a bit difficult. If something\\ndoesn’t make sense, keep reading and then re-read and I’m confident it will\\neventually <em>click</em>.</strong></p>\\n<p>Let’s start off with our components. Remember, one of the main points of Flux is\\nto take the storage of the data out of the component and put it in a more\\ncentral location (Store). Because of that, our components will look exactly the\\nsame except, as you probably guessed, we’ll be calling out to our Actions to add\\ndata and Stores to fetch data.</p>\\n<p>For the sake of having code snippets that demonstrate the principles I talk\\nabout, let’s pretend we’re building a basic Todo List app. I’ll obviously leave\\na lot of parts out, but I’ll include the parts that demonstrate the specific\\nFlux principle.</p>\\n<p>The full source code can be found\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/tylermcginnis/Flux-Todolist\\\">HERE</a>.</p>\\n<h4><strong>Component/View</strong></h4>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> React = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> AddItem = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./AddItem'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> List = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./List'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> todoStore = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../stores/todoStore'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> todoActions = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../actions/todoActions'</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> ListContainer = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">list</span>: todoStore.getList()\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">componentDidMount</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    todoStore.addChangeListener(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>._onChange);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">componentWillUnmount</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    todoStore.removeChangeListener(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>._onChange);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">handleAddItem</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">newItem</span>)</span>{\\n    todoActions.addItem(newItem);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">handleRemoveItem</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">index</span>)</span>{\\n    todoActions.removeItem(index);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">_onChange</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.setState({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">list</span>: todoStore.getList()\\n    })\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      &lt;div className=\\\"col-sm-6 col-md-offset-3\\\"&gt;\\n        &lt;div className=\\\"col-sm-12\\\"&gt;\\n          &lt;h3 className=\\\"text-center\\\"&gt; Todo List &lt;/h3&gt;\\n          &lt;AddItem add={this.handleAddItem}/&gt;\\n          &lt;List items={this.state.list} remove={this.handleRemoveItem}/&gt;\\n        &lt;/div&gt;\\n      &lt;/div&gt;\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n\\nmodule.exports = ListContainer;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Let’s break down this component.</p>\\n<p>First thing you’ll notice is the list property on the object which is being\\nreturned from <em>getIntiailState</em> doesn’t have a value of an empty array but its\\nvalue is instead whatever is being returned from <em>todoStore.getList()</em>. Remember\\nthe reason for this is because we’re taking the data out of the component and\\nputting it into the Store. We’ll cover more about the Store side of things later\\nin this tutorial.</p>\\n<p>Next, you’ll notice the <em>componentDidMount</em> and <em>componentWillUnmount</em> methods.\\nEach of those are calling methods on the todoStore which seem to be adding and\\nremoving an event listener. Head back up to the diagram for a second and reread\\nthe “Views/Component” section. Because we’re relying on the Store to house our\\ndata, we’ll need to make sure that whenever the data in the Store changes, our\\ncomponent knows about that and will update its own state. We accomplish this by\\npassing the store a method (<em>_onChange</em>) which will refetch the data from the\\nstore and update the components state. Now, whenever the Store changes its data,\\nit can invoke the callback function we initially passed it when the component\\nmounted (<em>_onChange</em>) which will make sure the component keeps its data up to\\ndate with what’s in the store. The <em>addChangeListener</em> piece is what’s tying the\\nstore back into the component.</p>\\n<p>The last thing to notice is that every time a user event occurs, whether it’s\\nadding a new item to the todo list (handleAddItem) or removing an item from the\\nlist (handleRemoveItem), we’re invoking a method on our todoActions rather than\\nusing *setState. *Again, this is because our main source of truth for our data\\nis the store, and as the diagram points out, we first need go through our\\nactions in order to eventually update the data in the store.</p>\\n<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>\\n<p>Let’s now take a look at our actions, or the second phase of our Flux diagram.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> AppDispatcher = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../dispatcher/AppDispatcher'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> appConstants = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../constants/appConstants'</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> todoActions = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">addItem</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">item</span>)</span>{\\n    AppDispatcher.handleAction({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">actionType</span>: appConstants.ADD_ITEM,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">data</span>: item\\n    });\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">removeItem</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">index</span>)</span>{\\n    AppDispatcher.handleAction({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">actionType</span>: appConstants.REMOVE_ITEM,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">data</span>: index\\n    })\\n  }\\n};\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = todoActions;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Referring back to the diagram, the Dispatcher is what is going to emit a certain\\nevent. Notice the way we keep track of these events is through a constants file.\\nBecause we need to emit a specific type of event, and also listen for that exact\\nsame type of event, a constants object makes perfect sense.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> appConstants = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">ADD_ITEM</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"ADD_ITEM\\\"</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">REMOVE_ITEM</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"REMOVE_ITEM\\\"</span>\\n};\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = appConstants;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Notice literally all this constants object is is a mirrored key value pair.\\nWhose keys/values are whatever the specific event is we’re emitting/listening\\nfor.</p>\\n<p>Back to our actions, since our Dispatcher is the one actually emitting an event,\\nour Actions object can be thought of as essentially just prepping an object\\nbefore it’s dispatched. Notice in our addItem method the actionType is\\nappConstants.addItem and the data is just the specific item we’re adding. These\\nkeys/values will eventually make themselves to our store where we can not only\\nlisten for that specific event (addItem) but also grab the data off of that\\npayload once it gets to the store.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dispatcher</strong></p>\\n<p>Now we’ve arrived at the 3rd part of our diagram, the Dispatcher. You can think\\nof the Dispatcher as the hub of your app. Every time you want to change the data\\nthat lives in a store, you must go through the Dispatcher.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Dispatcher = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'flux'</span>).Dispatcher;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> AppDispatcher = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> Dispatcher();\\n\\nAppDispatcher.handleAction = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">action</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.dispatch({\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">source</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'VIEW_ACTION'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">action</span>: action\\n  });\\n};\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = AppDispatcher;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You probably noticed there’s really not much going on here. That’s because,\\nthere really doesn’t need to be much going on. The whole point of the dispatcher\\nagain is to dispatch certain events. There are plenty of libraries that do this,\\nbut the recommended one is the one we’re using in the code above. It also\\nhappens to be the one facebook uses as well. We require the <em>flux</em> module, then\\ncreate a new instance of the Dispatcher on that module, then set a method on it\\nthat we’ll invoke from any <em>actions</em> in our app. The reason we’re using\\n*VIEW_ACTION *as the source of our dispatch is because you could also be using\\nSERVER_ACTION if that action was coming from the server. The only other thing is\\nto pass along the action which is passed in when handleAction is invoked (and\\ncontains the <em>actionType</em> as well as the <em>data</em>). What’s interesting about our\\nDispatcher is that most people don’t really mention that you’ll use the same\\ndispatcher in all your stores as well in order to register callbacks which will\\nbe invoked when certain Dispatches are dispatched. It’s a little weird at first,\\nbut you can think of the Dispatcher as kind of a bridge. In the main\\nDispatcher.js file is where you set up your <em>handleAction</em> method which will\\ndispatch the actual event, but you also need to make it so your stores actually\\nlisten to those events. So what’s interesting, and kind of confusing at first,\\nis inside your store you’ll require the Dispatcher which you exported from your\\nmain Dispatcher file in order to register some callbacks that will be invoked\\nwhenever the Dispatcher dispatches then hears those certain dispatches. We’ll\\nsee that in the next section on Stores. I realize that got super wordy but stick\\nwith me. The paragraph above will make more sense after reading this next\\nsection.</p>\\n<p><strong>Stores</strong></p>\\n<p>The store, where the magic happens. You can think of a Store as having <strong>four</strong>\\nparts.</p>\\n<p><strong>First</strong>: The actual “model” or data store. What’s great about Flux, is your\\n“model” is just a JavaScript data structure like an object or array. Everything\\nelse in the Store will be built around manipulating or getting this data.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _store = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">list</span>: []\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Second</strong>: Setter methods. Remember, the whole point of Flux is to make your\\ndata changes easy to reason about. These setter methods will be the only\\ninterface for manipulating the data of our store (which we made in the first\\nstep above).</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> addItem = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">item</span>)</span>{\\n  _store.list.push(item);\\n};\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> removeItem = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">index</span>)</span>{\\n  _store.list.splice(index, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>);\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Third</strong>: The Store itself, which is really just a collection of getter\\nfunctions in order to access the data in the first step along with a few\\nemitter/change listener helpers. Another idea of Flux that might throw you at\\nfirst is Getters vs Setters. Remember, we only want to be able to manipulate the\\ndata from our setter functions (which we made in the second step above).\\nHowever, we want to be able to GET the data whenever we like through our Getter\\nfunctions defined in this step. To accomplish this, we’ll make the setter\\nfunctions “private” to our Store file while we’ll export the actual Store (this\\nstep, or the collection of Getter methods) so that we can require the Store in\\nother files and invoke those getter methods in order to get the data. In other\\nwords, this step is going to be global, while the other steps will be “private”.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> todoStore = objectAssign({}, EventEmitter.prototype, {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">addChangeListener</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">cb</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.on(CHANGE_EVENT, cb);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">removeChangeListener</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">cb</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.removeListener(CHANGE_EVENT, cb);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getList</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> _store.list;\\n  },\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>A few things to note about the actual code above. Notice, as mentioned, we have\\nour <em>getList</em> method which just returns us the list. If you remember back to the\\ncomponent we built earlier, you’ll notice in <em>getInitialState</em> we’re invoking*\\ntodoStore.getList() *and setting the result to the list property on our state.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">getInitialState: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">list</span>: todoStore.getList()\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This <em>getList</em> method in the Store above is the interface for getting the data\\nout of the store. We also have the <em>addChangeListener</em> and *removeChangeListener\\n*methods. Again if you remember back to our component we built earlier, when our\\ncomponent mounted, we passed in <em>_.onChange</em> which just used setState to invoke\\n<em>todoStore.getList()</em> in order to refetch the data.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">_onChange: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.setState({\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">list</span>: todoStore.getList()\\n  })\\n},\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">componentDidMount</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  todoStore.addChangeListener(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>._onChange);\\n},\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">componentWillUnmount</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  todoStore.removeChangeListener(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>._onChange);\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Well, the cb parameter we’re passing to addChangeListener and\\n<em>removeChangeListener</em> is that <em>_.onChange</em> function. So now, whenever a\\n<em>CHANGE_EVENT</em> (or “<em>CHANGE</em>”) event is emitted, React will invoke <em>_.onChange</em>\\nwhich will update the state of the component.</p>\\n<p>The last thing to discuss about the <em>todoStore</em> itself above is the use of\\n<em>objectAssign</em> with <em>EventEmitter</em>. All <em>objectAssign</em> allows you to do is\\nextend/combine objects together in order to make “super objects” if you will. By\\nsuper objects, I mean objects whose keys/values are a collection of keys/values\\nfrom different objects. We pass <em>objectAssign</em> a target, or an empty object\\nfirst. This empty object is what the next two parameters are going to add their\\nproperties to. We then pass it EventEmitter.prototype. Now our empty object will\\nget all of the properties that are on the EventEmitter’s prototype object. This\\nwill give our store the ability to do things like .on() and .emit(). The last\\nargument is another object whose properties will be added to the empty object.\\nSo when everything is complete, the object being returned from <em>objectAssign</em> is\\nan object which has all of properties of EventEmitter’s prototype as well as\\n<em>adChangeListener</em>, <em>removeChangeListener</em>, and getList.</p>\\n<p><strong>Fourth</strong>: We need to use our Dispatcher to listen for certain events and when\\nwe hear those events, invoke the setter functions above (in the second step).</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">AppDispatcher.register(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">payload</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> action = payload.action;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">switch</span>(action.actionType){\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">case</span> appConstants.ADD_ITEM:\\n      addItem(action.data);\\n      todoStore.emit(CHANGE_EVENT);\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">break</span>;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">case</span> appConstants.REMOVE_ITEM:\\n      removeItem(action.data);\\n      todoStore.emit(CHANGE_EVENT);\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">break</span>;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">default</span>:\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">true</span>;\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Remember, when the handleAction method on our Dispatcher is invoked, it’s going\\nto dispatch an object which will look like this</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">source</span>: ‘VIEW_ACTION’,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">action</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">actionType</span>: ‘SOME_CONSTANT’,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">data</span>: ‘SOME DATA’\\n   }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So on our Switch statement, we’ll be checking the actionType in order to know\\nwhich action was emitted. Based on that actionType, we’ll know exactly what\\nsetter function (which we created in step 2 above) to invoke in order to modify\\nthe data. Once we invoke our setter function, we will then emit a change event,\\nthen, because in our addChangeListener method in our todoStore we set up the\\n.on() event handler, whenever it hears the change event, it will invoke the\\ncallback function which was passed to it which is _onChange from our original\\ncomponent.</p>\\n<p>Here’s the full code for the todoStore.js file.</p>\\n<pre><code

the\\nDispatcher.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>When our component mounts, we pass <em>_.onChange</em> to\\n<em>todoStore</em>.<em>addChangeListener</em> which makes it so whenever the Store hears the\\n“CHANGE” event, it will run <em>_.onChange</em> which will refetch the data from the\\nstore using <em>todoStore.getList()</em> and update its own state with the data\\nreturned from <em>getList()</em>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>A user clicks “Submit” wanting to add a new item to their todo list which\\ninvokes a method on the component which we’ll call <em>handleAddItem</em>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><em>handleAddItem</em> runs and invokes the todoActions.addItem method passing it the\\nnew item to add.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The <em>addItem</em> method on our <em>todoActions</em> object invokes\\n<em>AppDispatcher.handleAction</em> passing it an object with the actionType of\\n<em>appConstants.ADD_ITEM</em> and the data of the original todo item.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>When AppDispatcher.handleAction invokes, it emits <em>appConstants.ADD_ITEM</em>,\\nbecause of step 1, the callback we passed to *AppDispatcher.register *in our\\nStore

It’s predictable.</p>\\n<p>Let’s compare this to .slice’s friend, .splice</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> friends = [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Ryan'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Michael'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Dan'</span>]\\nfriends.splice(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// [\\\"Ryan\\\"]</span>\\nfriends.splice(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// [\\\"Michael\\\"]</span>\\nfriends.splice(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// [\\\"Dan\\\"]</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>.splice</strong> is not a pure function since each time we invoke it passing in the\\nsame arguments, we get a different result. It’s also modifying state.</p>\\n<p>Why is this important for React? Well the main reason is React’s <strong>render</strong>\\nmethod needs to be a pure function and because it’s a pure function, all of the\\nbenefits of pure functions now apply to your UI as well. Another reason is that\\nit’s a good idea to get used to making your functions pure and pushing “side\\neffects” to the boundaries of your program. I’ll say this throughout the course,\\nReact will make you a better developer if you learn React the right way.\\nLearning to write pure functions is the first step on that journey.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 450 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"React Tutorial 1.5: Utilizing Webpack and Babel to build a React.js App\",\"date\":\"2016-02-20T05:12:03.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/react-js-tutorial-1-5-utilizing-webpack-and-babel-to-build-a-react-js-app-5f804d729d3b/\",\"body\":\"<p>Let me preface this section by saying that Webpack is hard. Partially because\\nit’s an extremely powerful tool and partially because the documentation is\\nterrible. If you have experience with other tools like Gulp or Grunt it’s a bit\\neasier, but if you don’t, just hold on and it will get easier. We’re going to\\nhyperfocus on the real meat of Webpack for this course and jump into more\\nadvanced features in other courses.</p>\\n<p>The first questions you should ask yourself whenever you’re using a new tool are\\n“Why does this thing exist?” and “What problem is this thing solving?”. If you\\ncan’t eventually answer those two questions, you probably don’t need it. So\\nlet’s answer those questions in terms of Webpack.</p>\\n<p>Why does webpack exist? Webpack, at its core, is a code bundler. It takes your\\ncode, transforms and bundles it, then return a brand new version of your code.</p>\\n<p>What problem is this thing solving? Think about how many times we have to take\\nour code and change it so it’s compliant with what the browser is used to\\n(vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). If you’ve ever used a CSS Preprocessor like\\nSASS or LESS you know you need to transform your SASS/LESS code into normal CSS.\\nIf you’ve ever used CoffeeScript or any compile to JavaScript language you know\\nthere’s also a conversion step there. So where Webpack really shines is you’re\\nable to tell it every transformation your code needs to make, and it will do\\nthem and output a bundle file for you full of those changes (and some other\\nhelpful things as well like minification if you desire).</p>\\n<p>In this specific course we’re going to keep our Webpack configurations pretty\\nlight, but in future courses we’ll jump into some more advanced topics.</p>\\n<p>If you think about the process we talked about above, that idea of taking your\\ncode and transforming it in someway then spitting it out — there are really\\nthree main steps and three main things Webpack need to know.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Webpack needs to know the starting point of your application, or your root\\nJavaScript file.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Webpack needs to know which transformations to make on your code.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Webpack needs to know to which location it should save the new transformed\\ncode.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The code for this might look a little scary at first, but know that all we’re\\ndoing is coding out those three steps above so Webpack can understand them.</p>\\n<p>The first thing we need to do is create a file which is going to contain our\\nWebpack configurations. Conveniently, this file should be named\\n<strong>webpack.config.js</strong> and be located in the root directory of our project.</p>\\n<p>Now that we have our file made we need to make sure that this file exports an\\nobject which is going to represent our configurations for Webpack. If you’re not\\nfamiliar with JavaScript modules, I highly recommend <a href=\\\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/javascript-modules-a-beginner-s-guide-783f7d7a5fcc#.g9p44q9ly\\\">this blog\\nseries</a>\\nby <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/iam_preethi\\\">Preethi</a>.</p>\\n<p>Now let’s go ahead and walk down our list of those three items and convert them\\ninto code. First up, telling webpack where the entry point of our application is\\nlocated. This one is pretty straight forward and looks like this,</p>\\n<p>All we do is give our object a property of <strong>entry</strong> and a value which is an\\narray with a string which points to our root JavaScript file in our app. You\\nmight be asking why it’s an array instead of just a string. Webpack allows you\\nto have one or many entry points in your application. If you just have one, you\\ncan just use a string. If you have more, you can use an array. I always default\\nto an array so I can easily add more later if needed.</p>\\n<p>Now that we’ve told Webpack where to start, we need to tell it which\\ntransformations to actually make. This is where <strong>loaders</strong> will come in handy.</p>\\n<p>Let’s say that for some reason we’re still writing CoffeeScript in 2016 (ZING!).\\nWe would need a way to transform our CoffeeScript into regular JS. Sounds like\\nthe perfect place for a CoffeeScript loader. First step, we need to install the\\nloader we want. We’ll use npm to do this. In your terminal you would run <strong>npm\\ninstall — save-dev coffee-loader</strong> which would then save coffee-loader as a dev\\ndependency in your package.json file. Next, we need to configure our\\nwebpack.config.js file to be aware of this specific transform. To do that we’ll\\nfirst need to add a **module **property to the object we’re exporting in\\nwebpack.config.js and then that module property will have a property of\\n<strong>loaders</strong> which is an array.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// In webpack.config.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entry</span>: [\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./app/index.js'</span>\\n  ],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">module</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: []\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Inside of that loaders array is where we’re (obviously) going to put all of our\\ndifferent loaders or transformations we want to take place.</p>\\n<p>Each loader needs to be composed of three things. The first is which file type\\nto run the specific transformation on. For example, we don’t want to run CSS\\ntransformations on a JavaScript file and vice versa. The next item is which\\ndirectories should be included or excluded from being transformed. An example\\nhere is we don’t want to run our transformations on anything in our node_modules\\nfolder, so we’d have the node_modules path as an excluded value. The last thing\\nis the specific loader we want to run. Let’s take a look at what this looks\\nlike.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// In webpack.config.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entry</span>: [\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./app/index.js'</span>\\n  ],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">module</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [\\n      {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">test</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\.coffee$/</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">include</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/app'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loader</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"coffee-loader\\\"</span>}\\n    ]\\n  },\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The first thing you’ll probably notice is the <strong>test:/.js$/</strong> section. It looks\\nscary if you’re not used to regular expressions but all it’s doing is it tells\\nWebpack to run the coffee-loader on all extensions that end in .coffee.</p>\\n<p>Next, <strong>include</strong> tells Webpack which directories to include in our\\ntransformations. Instead of excluding node_modules, I chose to think positively\\nand include the directory we’d like transformed. Last step is an obvious one.\\n<strong>loader</strong> tells Webpack which transformation to run on all paths that match the\\n<strong>test</strong> RegEx and are in the <strong>include</strong> directory.</p>\\n<p>As you can see, the steps from including more loaders is pretty basic. NPM\\ninstall the specific loader then add a new object to the loaders array.</p>\\n<p>Now that we’ve done steps 1 and 2, we just have one more step. This last step is\\nspecifying where Webpack should output the new transformed code.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// In webpack.config.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entry</span>: [\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./app/index.js'</span>\\n  ],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">module</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [\\n      {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">test</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\.coffee$/</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">include</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/app'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loader</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"coffee-loader\\\"</span>}\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">output</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">filename</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"index_bundle.js\\\"</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">path</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/dist'</span>\\n  },\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Again the code here is pretty self explanatory. <strong>filename</strong> is the name of the\\nfile that Webpack is going to create which contains our new transformed code.\\n<strong>path</strong> is the specific directory where the new filename (<strong>index_bundle.js</strong>)\\nis going to be placed. If you’ve never seen <strong>__dirname</strong> before that’s just\\nreferencing the name of the directory that the currently executing script\\nresides in.</p>\\n<p>So now when Webpack runs, our code will be transformed and then can be\\nreferenced at <strong>ourApp/dist/index_bundle.js</strong>. Well that’s great, but now we\\nneed to come up with a plan to get our HTML to reference this specific file.\\nThere are a few options, but most are crappy. If we look at how normal apps are\\nusually structured it’s usually something like this.</p>\\n<pre><code>/app\\n  - components\\n  - containers\\n  - config\\n  - utils\\n  index.js\\n  index.html\\n/dist\\n  index.html\\n  index_bundle.js\\npackage.json\\nwebpack.config.js\\n.gitignore\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So as you can see, our code we’re developing with is found in the <strong>app</strong> folder\\nand our transformed code is in the <strong>dist</strong> folder. Now you can visually see the\\nissue. We want to change the <strong>index.html</strong> located in the <strong>app</strong> folder but\\nthe <strong>index.html</strong> file that the browser is actually going to be using is\\nlocated in the <strong>dist</strong> folder (because that’s where we’ve also told webpack to\\nspit out the transformed JS file).</p>\\n<p>The first option to solve this is to just manage two index.html files and\\nwhenever you change the one located in /app, copy/paste that to the one located\\nin /dist. Though this will work, I won’t be able to look my Wife in the eyes\\nagain if we do this.</p>\\n<p>Second option, we could figure out a way so that whenever webpack runs, our\\n<strong>/app/index.html</strong> gets copied over to <strong>/dist/index.html</strong>. This sounds a lot\\nbetter and the final solution will look close to this.</p>\\n<p>As you can probably guess, there’s already a Webpack tool that allows us to do\\nsomething similar. Instead of actually copying our index.html file, it’s just\\ngoing to use that file as a template and create a brand new index.html file.\\nThis plugin is the html-webpack-plugin. As always, you’ll need to run <strong>npm\\ninstall — save-dev html-webpack-plugin</strong> before you can use it. Now we just need\\nto tell webpack what we want to do with it.</p>\\n<p>First thing, we’ll need to create a new instance of HTMLWebpackPlugin and we’ll\\nneed to specify three things. First, we can give it a <strong>template</strong> of what we\\nwant the newly created file to look like. Second, we give it a <strong>filename</strong> or,\\nwell, what the new file it creates is going to be called. Third,\\nWebpackPluginConfig is going to be smart enough to detect the filename of the\\noutput of the transformed code (in this case we’re calling index_bundle.js) and\\nit then going to inject a script into the <head> or <body> of the newly created\\nindex.html file. So the third option is <strong>inject</strong> and is where you would like\\nto inject that script — the ‘head’ or the ‘body’.</p>\\n<p>Let’s see what all the code looks like.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// In webpack.config.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HtmlWebpackPlugin = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'html-webpack-plugin'</span>)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HTMLWebpackPluginConfig = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> HtmlWebpackPlugin({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">template</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/app/index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">filename</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">inject</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'body'</span>\\n});\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entry</span>: [\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./app/index.js'</span>\\n  ],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">module</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [\\n      {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">test</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\.coffee$/</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">include</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/app'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loader</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"coffee-loader\\\"</span>}\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">output</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">filename</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"index_bundle.js\\\"</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">path</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/dist'</span>\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">plugins</span>: [HTMLWebpackPluginConfig]\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You’ll notice we’ve added a few more steps. At the top of the file we create a\\nnew instance of <strong>HtmlWebpackPlugin</strong> and we give it three options. <strong>template</strong>\\npoints to our regular index.html file located in our app directory. <strong>filename</strong>\\njust says we want to keep the name index.html. <strong>inject</strong> says to inject a\\nscript which references the name of the output file (index_bundle.js) of our\\nloaders and put it in the body of this newly created HTML file. Lastly we add\\nthe <strong>HTMLWebpackPluginConfig</strong> variable we created as an item in the array of\\n<strong>plugins</strong> in our webpack config.</p>\\n<p>Now when we run **webpack **from our command line, inside of our <strong>dist</strong> folder\\nwe’ll have two files. <strong>index_bundle.js</strong> and <strong>index.html</strong>.\\n<strong>index_bundle.js</strong> is the result of taking our <strong>entry</strong> code and running it\\nthrough our loaders. While <strong>index.html</strong> was created on the fly with\\n<strong>HTMLWebpackPluginConfig</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Let’s take a look at what our index.html file inside of our <strong>app</strong> folder looks\\nlike then what our newly created index.html file inside of <strong>dist</strong> looks like.</p>\\n<p><strong>app/index.html</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">html</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">lang</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"en\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">head</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">meta</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">charset</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"UTF-8\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">title</span>&gt;</span>My App<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">title</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">link</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">rel</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"stylesheet\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">href</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"styles.css\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">head</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">body</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">id</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"app\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">html</span>&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>dist/index.html</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">html</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">lang</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"en\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">head</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">meta</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">charset</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"UTF-8\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">title</span>&gt;</span>My App<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">title</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">link</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">rel</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"stylesheet\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">href</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"styles.css\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">head</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">body</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">id</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"app\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"index_bundle.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">html</span>&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You’ll notice that the only difference between the two files is that the one in\\n<strong>dist</strong> (which was created with HTMLWebpackPlugin) now has a script tag\\npointing to** index_bundle.js** . Again, the only real magic going on here is\\nthat HTMLWebpackConfig is smart enough to detect the <strong>output</strong> <strong>filename</strong> of\\nyour newly created file from Webpack and it will automatically add that as a\\nscript in your newly create index.html file. So in our example we used**\\nindex_bundle.js** as the <strong>output filename</strong> so as you can see in the created\\nindex.html file above, we have now have <strong><script\\nsrc=”index_bundle.js”></script></strong> inside the body. If we were to change the\\noutput of our webpack config to be <strong>OUR-AWESOME-JS-FILE.js</strong>, then inside the\\nbody of our newly create index.html file we would have <strong><script\\nsrc=”OUR-AWESOME-JS-FILE.js”></script></strong></p>\\n<p>Now the only other crucial piece of information is how to actually tell webpack\\nto run.</p>\\n<p>If you’ve installed webpack globally (by running <strong>npm install -g webpack</strong>)\\nthen you have access to the webpack CLI. (If you haven’t, the same rules below\\napply but you’ll just have to just npm scripts to run them).</p>\\n<p>In the root directory of your app (or wherever webpack.config.js is located),\\nyou can run <strong>webpack</strong> from your terminal and that will do a one time run\\nthrough of your webpack settings. However, this can be kind of a pain to keep\\nhaving to run the command over and over whenever you change anything. To fix\\nthis, run <strong>webpack -w</strong> and that will watch your files and re-execute\\n<strong>webpack</strong> whenever any of the files Webpack is concerned about changes.\\nLastly, if you’re wanting to ship to production, you can run <strong>webpack -p</strong> and\\nthat will run through the normal transformations as well as minify your code.</p>\\n<p>So now you’re probably thinking, “Hey Tyler. That’s cool and all, but I came\\nhere for React and I still haven’t seen any of it.” First off, calm down.\\nSecond, that’s fair. The good news is you already have all the Webpack knowledge\\nyou need to get going with React. Now we just need to look at a tool called\\nbabel and add it as a loader.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/\\\">Babel.js</a> is a wonderful tool for compiling your\\nJavaScript. With Webpack you tell it which transformations to make on your code,\\nwhile Babel is the specific transformation itself. In terms of React, Babel is\\ngoing to allow us to transform our JSX (which you’ll see soon) into actual\\nJavaScript. What’s nice about Babel though is it can be used for much more than\\njust JSX -&gt; JS transformations. You can also opt into “future” versions of\\nJavaScript (ES2015, 2016, etc) and use Babel to transform your future JavaScript\\nto modern day JavaScript so the browser can understand it. Let’s jump into what\\nthis looks like.</p>\\n<p>As always we’ll need to NPM install some things. Babel is very modular, so we’ll\\nneed to install a few things initially. If you’re following along you can run\\n<strong>npm install — save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react</strong>.\\nbabel-core is babel itself, babel-loader is the webpack loader we’ll use, and\\nbabel-preset-react is to get the JSX -&gt; JS transformation going.</p>\\n<p>You might have the temptation to add a new loader to webpack for each type of\\nBabel transformation we want to make but that’s not the case. Instead, you just\\ngive Webpack the single** babel-loader **we installed then that loader will look\\nto a <strong>.babelrc</strong> file that we’ll make for each of the babel transformations you\\nwant to make.</p>\\n<p>First, in the same directory where the <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> file is (usually\\nthe root directory), we’ll need to make a <strong>.babelrc</strong> file which looks like\\nthis</p>\\n<pre><code>{\\n  &quot;presets&quot;: [\\n    &quot;react&quot;\\n  ]\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Again all this file does is it instructs our babel-loader which babel\\ntransformations to actually make. For now, all we care about is the react\\ntransform. This works because we npm installed babel-preset-react earlier.</p>\\n<p>Now all we need to do is add the babel-loader as a loader to our\\nwebpack.config.js file.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// In webpack.config.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HtmlWebpackPlugin = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'html-webpack-plugin'</span>)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HTMLWebpackPluginConfig = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> HtmlWebpackPlugin({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">template</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/app/index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">filename</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">inject</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'body'</span>\\n});\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entry</span>: [\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./app/index.js'</span>\\n  ],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">output</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">path</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/dist'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">filename</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"index_bundle.js\\\"</span>\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">module</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [\\n      {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">test</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\.js$/</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">include</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/app'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loader</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"babel-loader\\\"</span>}\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">plugins</span>: [HTMLWebpackPluginConfig]\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You’ll notice everything here is the same but instead of our ugly coffee-script\\nloader, we’re not using our babel-loader.</p>\\n<p>That’s it!

To answer this question, we’ll dive into React Life Cycle methods.\\nLifecycle methods are special methods each component can have that allow us to\\nhook into the views when specific conditions happen (i.e. when the component\\nfirst renders or when the component gets updated with new data, etc).</p>\\n<p>There are many different life cycle methods, but in this post we’re going to\\nexplore the ones that are used most often (which will cover ~90% of use cases).</p>\\n<p>You can really break React’s Life Cycle Methods down into two categories.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>When a component get mounted to the DOM and unmounted.</li>\\n<li>When a component receives new data.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>Mounting / Unmounting</strong></p>\\n<p>In this section we’re going to focus on those life cycle methods which are\\ncalled when the component is initialized and added to the DOM (mounting), and\\nwhen the component is removed from the DOM (unmounting).

Sometimes you’ll want your\\ncomponent to manage some piece of state. In order to do that you’ll first need\\nto set some initial state of your component when your component is first added\\nto the DOM.

If it’s false, that component (and naturally all child\\ncomponents), won’t re-render.

I don’t think I’ve been to bed before this time in over a month.\\nI’m ok with this, however. I’ve always loved teaching and for the most part I\\nthink people enjoy my teaching as well. I spent two years teaching the people of\\nLos Angeles about Jesus, so teaching literally anything else seems pretty\\nsimple, since, well, many people don’t want to listen to a 19 year old talk\\nabout Jesus.</p>\\n<p>I started teaching technical topics at <a href=\\\"http://devmounta.in/\\\">DevMountain</a> and\\nshortly after took over all operations of their whole Web program. It was a\\nblast and it taught me how to teach technical topics quickly and efficiently.\\nTeaching is essentially the same thing as programming except instead of\\nprogramming computers you’re programming brains. Teaching at DevMountain was\\ndone entirely in person and it was here I also learned how to build curriculum\\nto supplement teaching. Last March I wanted to see if the “bootcamp” approach\\ncould be taken outside of the context of beginners and carefully turned towards\\nmid-sr level developers. I launched <a href=\\\"http://www.reactweek.com/\\\">React Week</a> with\\nthis goal in mind and from what I could see, everyone enjoyed it.</p>\\n<p>Later I started teaching on\\n<a href=\\\"https://egghead.io/instructors/tyler-mcginnis\\\">Egghead.io</a>. Teaching short (3–5\\nminute) videos is much different than full hour long classes in person. It’s\\nlike snowboarding and skateboarding. It helps to know one, but it’s still\\nentirely different. Luckily the great people at Egghead have the system down and\\nthey’ve graciously shared the tips with their instructors.</p>\\n<p>Somewhere in all of this I started blogging more and learned to love writing\\nabout technical topics.</p>\\n<p>At this point I had pretty solid experience in basically every format of\\nteaching — in person, online via recorded videos, and through text via my blog.\\nInterestingly enough I wouldn’t say that one medium is more effective over the\\nother — they’re all just, different. Combine this sort of thinking/experience\\nwith the outcry of JavaScript fatigue in the community and <a href=\\\"http://www.reactjsprogram.com/\\\">React.js\\nProgram</a> was born. The goal is to take my unique\\nviews of teaching through different mediums and combine it into one program.</p>\\n<p>The whole premise of React.js Program is that the student is going to have three\\ndifferent learning approaches thrown at them. First via text. Second via a\\nvideo. Third via curriculum.</p>\\n<p>Not only are there different learning mediums, but each medium has different\\nprerequisite knowledge applied to it. When teaching you have to walk the thin\\nline of practical and easy to consume. Building projects bring practicality but\\nthey also require a prerequisite knowledge of the other parts of the codebase\\n(and even if they don’t, students are convinced they do). Having hyper focused\\nexamples are easy to consume but then students struggle with “putting the pieces\\ntogether”. My solution to this was having the text sections be hyper focused and\\nhaving the videos be project based. Naturally this means that each text section\\ncan stand by itself (and for the most part can even be read out of order) while\\nthe video examples have a specific order since we’re building a project\\ntogether. Combine this with actual projects students are required to work\\nthrough on their own to apply what’s been taught via text and videos and you can\\nsee why I haven’t slept in a while 🙃.</p>\\n<p>I think there are those times in life when you’re about to release something\\ninto the world that you’ve been working tirelessly on and are nervous about the\\noutcome. This is one of those times for me.</p>\\n<p>I’m hopeful though.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 453 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Incentivizing Open Source Authors\",\"date\":\"2016-06-07T14:12:03.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/incentivizing-open-source-authors-3830dd00f55e/\",\"body\":\"<p>As developers, Open Source Software (OSS) is foundational to what we do every\\nday.

My husband and I are going to walk over there and sit down.</p>\\n<p><strong>A declarative approach (WHAT)</strong>: Table for two, please.</p>\\n<p>The imperative approach is concerned with HOW you’re actually going to get a\\nseat. You need to list out the steps to be able to show HOW you’re going to get\\na table.The declarative approach is more concerned with WHAT you want, a table\\nfor two.</p>\\n<p>“Ok.” — your brain</p>\\n<p>More metaphors!</p>\\n<p>I’m going to ask you a question. I want you to think of both an imperative\\nresponse and a declarative response.</p>\\n<p>“I’m by Wal-Mart. How do I get to your house from here?”</p>\\n<hr>\\n<hr>\\n<hr>\\n<p>An imperative response: Go out of the north exit of the parking lot and take a\\nleft. Get on I-15 south until you get to the Bangerter Highway exit. Take a\\nright off the exit like you’re going to Ikea. Go straight and take a right at\\nthe first light. Continue through the next light then take your next left. My\\nhouse is #298.</p>\\n<p>A declarative response: My address is 298 West Immutable Alley, Draper Utah\\n84020</p>\\n<p>Regardless of how I get to your house, what really matters is the car I drive.\\nAm I going to drive an <em>imperative</em> stick shift car or a <em>declarative</em> automatic\\ncar. Enough metaphors?</p>\\n<p>Before we dive into code, it’s important to realize thatmany declarative\\napproaches have some sort of imperative abstraction layer. Look at all of our\\nexamples:</p>\\n<p>The declarative response to the Red Lobster employee is assuming that the Red\\nLobster employee knows all the imperative steps to get us to the table. Knowing\\nthe address assumes you have some sort of GPS that knows the imperative steps of\\nhow to get to your house.</p>\\n<p>Anautomatic car has some sort of abstraction layer overshifting gears.</p>\\n<p>That was the realization that really made it click for me, soI’ll repeat it:\\nMany (if not all) declarative approacheshave some sort of underlying imperative\\nabstraction.</p>\\n<p>If that sentence makes sense, you’re doing great!</p>\\n<p>Now, we’re going to attempt to take the leap from metaphorical happy land to\\nreal world code land. To make the leap more graceful, let’s look at some\\nprogramming “languages” that are inherently declarative versus those which are\\nimperative by nature.</p>\\n<p>Imperative: C, C++, Java<br> Declarative: SQL, HTML<br> (Can Be) Mix:\\nJavaScript, C#, Python</p>\\n<p>Think about your typical SQL or HTML example,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sql\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">SELECT</span> * <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">FROM</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">Users</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">WHERE</span> Country=’Mexico’;\\n</code></pre>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">article</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">header</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">h1</span>&gt;</span>Declarative Programming<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">h1</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">p</span>&gt;</span>Sprinkle Declarative in your verbiage to sound smart<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">p</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">header</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">article</span>&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>By glancing at both examples, you have a very clear understanding of what is\\ngoing on. They’re both declarative. They’re concerned with WHAT you want done,\\nrather than HOW you want it done.</p>\\n<p>You’re describing what you’re trying to achieve, without instructing how to do\\nit. The implementation of selecting all of the users who live in Mexico has been\\nabstracted from you. You’re not concerned with how the web browser is parsing\\nyour <em>article</em> and displaying it to the screen. Your WHAT is <em>Mexican users</em> and\\na <em>new header</em> and <em>paragraph</em> on your website.</p>\\n<p>So far so good. Let’s dive into more practical JavaScript examples.</p>\\n<p>I want you to pretend you’re now in a technical interview and I’m the\\ninterviewer. Open up your console and answer the following questions.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Write a function called <em>double</em> which takes in an array of numbers and returns\\na new array after doubling every item in that array. <em>double([1,2,3]) -&gt;\\n[2,4,6]</em></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Write a function called <em>add</em> which takes in an array and returns the result of\\nadding up every item in the array. <em>add([1,2,3]) -&gt; 6</em></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Using jQuery (or vanilla JavaScript), add a <em>click</em> event handler to the element\\nwhich has an id of <em>btn</em>. When clicked, toggle (add or remove) the\\n<em>highlight</em> class as well as change the text to <em>Add Highlight</em> or <em>Remove\\nHighlight</em> depending on the current state of the element.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Let’s look at the most common approaches to these problems, which all happen to\\nalso be imperative approaches.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">double</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">arr</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">let</span> results = []\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">let</span> i = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>; i &lt; arr.length; i++){\\n    results.push(arr[i] * <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>)\\n  }\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> results\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<ol start=\\\"2\\\">\\n<li></li>\\n</ol>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">add</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">arr</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">let</span> result = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">let</span> i = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>; i &lt; arr.length; i++){\\n    result += arr[i]\\n  }\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> result\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\\n<li></li>\\n</ol>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">$(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"#btn\\\"</span>).click(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  $(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>).toggleClass(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"highlight\\\"</span>)\\n  $(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>).text() === <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Add Highlight'</span>\\n    ? $(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>).text(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Remove Highlight'</span>)\\n    : $(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>).text(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Add Highlight'</span>)\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>By examining what all three of these imperative examples have in common, we’ll\\nbe able to better identify what actually makes them imperative.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>The most obvious commonality is that they’re describing <strong>HOW</strong> to do something.\\nIn each example we’re either explicitly iterating over an array or explicitly\\nlaying out steps for how to implement the functionality we want.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>This one might not be as obvious if you’re not used to thinking in the\\n<em>declarative</em> or even more specifically <em>functional</em> way. In each example\\nwe’re mutating some piece of state (If you’re unfamiliar with the term state,\\nit’s basically information about something held in memory — which should sound a\\nlot like variables). In the first two examples we create a variable called\\nresults and then we continually modify it. In the third example we don’t have\\nany variables, but we still have state living in the DOM itself — we then modify\\nthat state in the DOM.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>This one is a bit subjective, but to me the code above isn’t very readable. I\\ncan’t just glance at the code and understand what’s going on. My brain needs to\\nstep through the code just as an interpreter wouldwhile also taking into account\\nthe context in which the code lives(another negativity of mutable data).</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>All right, enough 💩ing on the code. Let’s now take a look at some declarative\\nexamples. The goal is to fix all the problems from above. So each example needs\\nto describe <strong>WHAT</strong> is happening, can’t mutate state, and should be readable at a\\nglance.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li></li>\\n</ol>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">double</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">arr</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> arr.map(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">item</span>) =&gt;</span> item * <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>)\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<ol start=\\\"2\\\">\\n<li></li>\\n</ol>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">add</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">arr</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> arr.reduce(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">prev, current</span>) =&gt;</span> prev + current, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>)\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\\n<li></li>\\n</ol>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">&lt;Btn\\n  onToggleHighlight={this.handleToggleHighlight}\\n  highlight={this.state.highlight}&gt;\\n    {this.state.buttonText}\\n&lt;/Btn&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Much better 🤓</p>\\n<p>Notice that in the first two example we’re leveraging JavaScript’s built in <em>map</em>\\nand <em>reduce</em> methods. This goes back to what we’ve been talking about over and\\nover in this article that most declarative solutions are an abstraction over\\nsome imperative implementation.</p>\\n<p>In every example we’re describing WHAT we want to happen rather than HOW (we\\ndon’t know HOW map and reduce are implemented, we also don’t care). We’re not\\nmutating any state. All of the mutations are abstracted inside of <em>map</em> and\\n<em>reduce</em>. It’s also more readable (once you get used to <em>map</em> and <em>reduce</em>, of\\ncourse).</p>\\n<p>Now what about #3? Well I cheated a little bit, and am using\\n<a href=\\\"http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals\\\">React</a> — but\\nnote that all three imperative mistakes are still fixed. The real beauty of\\nReact is that you can create these declarative user interfaces. By looking at\\nour Btn component, I’m able to easily understand what the UI is going to look\\nlike. Another benefit is instead of state living in the DOM, it lives in the\\nReact component itself.</p>\\n<p>Another less-spoken-of benefit to declarative code is that your program can be\\ncontext-independent. This means that because your code is concerned with what the\\nultimate goal is— rather than the steps it takes to accomplish that goal — the\\nsame code can be used in different programs, and work just fine.</p>\\n<p>Look at all three of our examples above. We can consume both functions and\\ncomponent in any program we want. They’re program agnostic. This is hard to do\\nwith imperative code because often times, by definition, imperative code relies\\non the context of the current state.</p>\\n<p>One thing that I didn’t go too far into is how functional programming is a\\nsubset of declarative programming. If you haven’t already, I highly recommend\\ngetting more familiar with functional programming techniques in JavaScript.\\nStart with <em>.map</em>, <em>.reduce</em>, <em>.filter</em> and work your way up from there.</p>\\n<p>Odds are there isn’t a lower hanging fruit to improve your codebase than making\\nit more functional.</p>\\n<p>Here are some other definitions that I’ve found on the internet that may or may not be helpful.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Declarative programming is “the act of programming in languages that conform to\\nthe mental model of the developer rather than the operational model of the\\nmachine”.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Declarative Programming is programming with declarations, i.e. declarative\\nsentences.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The declarative property is where there can exist only one possible set of statements that can express each specific modular semantic.The imperative\\nproperty is the dual, where semantics are inconsistent under composition and/or\\ncan be expressed with variations of sets of statements.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Declarative languages contrast with imperativelanguages which <strong>specify explicit\\nmanipulation of the computer’s internal state</strong>; or procedural languages which\\nspecify an explicit sequence of steps to follow.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm that\\nexpresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 455 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"\\\"create-react-app\\\" and the future of creating React applications\",\"date\":\"2016-07-22T16:35:26.778Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/create-react-app-and-the-future-of-creating-react-applications/\",\"body\":\"<p>Over the past few years, I’ve been heavily involved with teaching people how to\\nbuild applications with React.js.

You can just focus on what you really care about: building\\nthe actual app.</p>\\n<p>If we <strong>cd</strong> into our <strong>Awesome</strong> project, we’ll have a folder structure that\\nlooks like this:</p>\\n<pre><code>Awesome/\\n  README.md\\n  index.html\\n  favicon.ico\\n  node_modules/\\n  package.json\\n  src/\\n    App.css\\n    App.js\\n    index.css\\n    index.js\\n    logo.svg\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and a very minimal package.json:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">{\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"name\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Awesome\\\"</span>,\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"version\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"0.0.1\\\"</span>,\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"devDependencies\\\"</span>: {\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react-scripts\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"0.1.0\\\"</span>\\n   },\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"dependencies\\\"</span>: {\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"^15.2.1\\\"</span>,\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react-dom\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"^15.2.1\\\"</span>\\n   },\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"scripts\\\"</span>: {\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react-scripts start\\\"</span>,\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"build\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react-scripts build\\\"</span>,\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"eject\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react-scripts eject\\\"</span>\\n   }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You’ll notice you have three options: <strong>start</strong>, <strong>build</strong>, and <strong>eject</strong>.</p>\\n<p><strong>start</strong> is what you’re probably already familiar with. It will start up a\\nlocal development server on <strong>localhost:3000</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>build</strong> will prep your app for production by correctly bundling React in\\nproduction mode (by setting NODE_ENV to <em>production</em>), minifying your code (with\\nfilename hashing), and outputting the result to a <strong>build</strong> folder.</p>\\n<p><strong>eject</strong> is the interesting one. Our friends over on the React team are pretty\\nsmart, and they didn’t want you to be “locked in” to their specific\\nconfigurations for the lifetime of this project. Because of this, you have the\\nability to <em>eject</em>.</p>\\n<p><strong>eject</strong> will take all of the default configuration and build dependencies\\ngiven to you by <strong>create-react-app</strong>, then move them into the project\\nitself. This way your project can continue from exactly where it is. But now\\nyou’ll have the ability to modify any of the default configurations you were\\ngiven by <strong>create-react-app</strong>.</p>\\n<p>The downside of <strong>eject</strong> is that once you run it, you can’t go back.</p>\\n<p>To see this in action, if you run <strong>npm run eject</strong>, your package.json file\\nchanges from the code above, to this:</p>\\n<pre><code

eslint.js\\n    webpack.config.dev.js\\n    webpack.config.prod.js\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So it’s just like we described above: all of the configuration settings that\\nwere abstracted from us earlier have now been moved into our project, so we have\\ndirect control over them from that point on.</p>\\n<p>There are some other great features, besides just the ability to <strong>eject</strong>. I\\nthink the main goal of this project was to take the &quot;most common denominator&quot;\\nfeatures, if you will, and tie them into a CLI.</p>\\n<p>Out of the box you get:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>React, JSX, ES6 (and some ES+)</li>\\n<li>the ability to import CSS and images directly from JavaScript</li>\\n<li>CSS, which is automagically autoprefixed</li>\\n<li>a production build script as we talked about earlier</li>\\n<li>a development server, which will lint for common errors</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>All of which are pretty fundamental and universal for building a React app.</p>\\n<p>Now, with that said, you’ll notice there are some pretty fundamental pieces\\nstill missing.</p>\\n<p>It’s difficult to make so many decisions without trudging over the &quot;opinionated&quot;\\nline. This project is opinionated, and with those opinions comes tradeoffs.</p>\\n<p>The README points out that there’s still no support for the following</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>testing</li>\\n<li>server Rendering</li>\\n<li>some experimental syntax extensions (like decorators)</li>\\n<li>CSS Modules</li>\\n<li>LESS or Sass</li>\\n<li>hot reloading of components</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This might be a deal breaker for some of you. Many of those things have become\\nstandard for building a real “production grade” React app. However, if you’re\\nthe type of person who is doing Server Side Rendering along with decorators,\\nyou’re most likely not the target market here.</p>\\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\\n<p>Overall, I’m excited for this project. It benefits the part of the community\\nwhich desperately needed more guidelines and help getting started while not\\nreally affecting everyone else who already had their own process.</p>\\n<p>Do I think you should still learn Webpack and Babel? Absolutely. But now, that\\ndecision is up to you.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 456 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"400: My Declarative Approach to Accomplishing Goals\",\"date\":\"2016-08-01T18:12:03.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/400-my-declarative-approach-to-accomplishing-goals-9d2e1d2e5307/\",\"body\":\"<p>As the amount of items we need to finish for a given day grows, one or both of\\nthese natural tendencies seem to occur.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>We become complacent with what we’ve already achieved.</li>\\n<li>We become overwhelmed with everything else we still need to achieve.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>This phenomenon is so common that it’s become a very overplayed meme.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*hDMwe57oOA3iXKeOnHsPIA.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>My hope is that there’s a solution, and that the solution can be found from a\\nfundamental principle of the software world — finding the right abstraction.</p>\\n<p>Everyday both in software and in the real world we deal with different levels of\\nabstraction. When you start your car, you don’t need to worry about sending a\\nsignal to your starter solenoid, rotating your flywheel, or making sure fuel is\\nproperly mixed with air and sent to your piston cylinder device — all of that is\\nabstracted away from you so you can focus on driving to your destination. When\\nyou create a React component you’re (typically) not concerned with how React’s\\nreconciliation process works to make DOM diffing more effective —\\nReact.Component is an abstraction layer over that complexity. This allows you to\\nfocus on what is more important to you, which is probably building great user\\ninterfaces.</p>\\n<p>The right abstraction will offer huge dividends while the wrong abstraction can\\nbe detrimental to a project.</p>\\n<p>Theoretically, this same principle can apply to our goals as well. The right\\nabstraction layer over our goals will allow us to focus on our own personal\\nprogression while the wrong (or no) abstraction layer will leave us overwhelmed\\nwhile focusing on the implementation details.</p>\\n<p>Essentially I want to take a more\\n<a href=\\\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/imperative-vs-declarative-programming-283e96bf8aea\\\">declarative</a>\\napproach to accomplishing my goals.</p>\\n<p>Before creating an abstraction, we need to know what we’re going to abstract.\\nWe’ll be attempting to abstract my goals for the month of August.</p>\\n<p>For some context if you don’t know me. I’m the sole engineer of a startup called\\n<a href=\\\"http://speroforcancer.com/\\\">Spero</a> which is connecting everyone in the world\\naffected by Cancer. We’re currently in beta on iOS only and in the next month we\\nhope to launch on Android as well as launch out of beta. I run <a href=\\\"http://reactjsprogram.com/\\\">React.js\\nProgram</a> which is a linear approach to learning the\\nReact ecosystem. I currently have three of the eventual five courses finished\\nand there are 27,000 very friendly students encouraging me to finish the final\\ntwo courses. I’m co-authoring a book on React called <a href=\\\"https://www.fullstackreact.com/\\\">Full Stack\\nReact</a>. I’m also married (with no kids).</p>\\n<p>My August goals.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Launch Spero Updates</li>\\n<li>Launch Spero on Android</li>\\n<li>Launch more Spero updates to go “out of beta”</li>\\n<li>Start (and finish) the React Native section for Full Stack React book.</li>\\n<li>Blog 5 times</li>\\n<li>Launch React.js Program’s “<a href=\\\"http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactnative\\\">React\\nNative</a>” course</li>\\n<li>Update React.js Program’s “<a href=\\\"http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals\\\">React\\nFundamentals</a>”\\ncourse</li>\\n<li>Exercise 4X a week (and eat healthy, etc etc)</li>\\n<li>Some more personal/family goals I won’t list here</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If I get caught up in the implementation details, I’ll fail. I always do. I tend\\nto focus on the fact that I “have so much to do” rather than focus on “doing”.</p>\\n<p>The obvious abstraction over those goals is in using productive hours in order\\nto generalize “accomplishment”.</p>\\n<p><em>Productive Hours = Hours Logged * Productivity Percentage</em></p>\\n<p>My hope is that by focusing entirely on increasing the amount of productive\\nhours I output, I’ll limit feeling overwhelmed with the details while maximizing\\nmy productivity.</p>\\n<p>After analyzing all of my goals, I think the realistic number of productive\\nhours it will take to accomplish them is <strong>400</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Now comes the question of measuring productivity. This one is easier than it\\nseems. I’m using <a href=\\\"http://rescuetime.com/\\\">Rescue Time</a> which keeps track of my\\ntime spent on my computer and gives me a daily/weekly/monthly breakdown of total\\ntime and also gives me a productivity score for that time.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0ZIsysM4QOHtwO78L_g1mg.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>The only other metric that will count towards my “total productive hours” count\\nis exercise which is easily trackable. *<em>Note.

In\\norder to answer this question, we need to take a deep dive into that\\nabstraction.</p>\\n<p>Let’s start by looking at the absolute fundamentals of React. What is React?\\nIt’s a library for building user interfaces. No matter how complex React or the\\nReact ecosystem seem to be, this is React at its core — building UIs. With this\\nin mind, we arrive at our first definition, an <strong>Element</strong>. Simply put, <em>a React\\nelement describes what you want to see on the screen</em>. Not so simply put, <em>a\\nReact element is an object representation of a DOM node</em>. Notice I used the word\\n<em>describe</em>. It’s important to note that a React element isn’t actually the thing\\nyou’ll see on your screen, instead, it’s just an object representation of it.\\nThere’s a few reasons for this. The first is that JavaScript objects are\\nlightweight — React can create and destroy these elements without too much\\noverhead. The second reason is React is able to analyze the object, then analyze\\nthe actual DOM, and then update the actual DOM only where a change occurred.\\nThis has some performance upsides to it.</p>\\n<p>In order to create our object representation of a DOM node (aka React element),\\nwe can use React’s <em>createElement</em> method.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> element = React.createElement(\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'div'</span>,\\n  {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">id</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'login-btn'</span>},\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Login'</span>\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><em>createElement</em> takes in three arguments. The first is a tag name string (div,\\nspan, etc), the second is any attributes you want the element to have, the third\\nis contents or the children of the element, in this case the text “Login”. The\\n<em>createElement</em> invocation above is going to return an object with this shape,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'div'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Login'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">id</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'login-btn'</span>\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and when it’s rendered to the DOM (using ReactDOM.render), we’ll have a new DOM\\nnode that looks like this,</p>\\n<pre><code>&lt;div id='login-btn'&gt;Login&lt;/div&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So far, so good. What’s interesting about learning React is that typically the\\nfirst thing you’re taught is components. “Components are the building blocks of\\nReact”. Notice, however, that we started this post with elements. The reason for\\nthis is because once you understand elements, understanding components is a\\nsmooth transition. <em>A component is a function or a Class which optionally\\naccepts input and returns a React element.</em></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Button</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ onLogin }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> React.createElement(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'div'</span>,\\n    {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">id</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'login-btn'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>: onLogin},\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Login'</span>\\n  )\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>By definition, we have a Button component which accepts an onLogin input and\\nreturns a React element. One thing to note is that our Button component receives\\nan <em>onLogin</em> method as its prop. To pass that along to our object representation\\nof the DOM, we pass it along as the second argument to createElement, just as we\\ndid our id attribute.</p>\\n<p>Let’s go deeper.</p>\\n<p>Up until this point we’ve only covered creating React elements with the “type”\\nproperty of native HTML elements (“span”, “div”, etc), but you can also pass in\\nother React components to the first argument of createElement.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> element = React.createElement(\\n  User,\\n  {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler McGinnis'</span>},\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>However, unlike with an HTML tag name, if React sees a <em>class <em>or a</em> function</em>\\nas the first argument, it will then check to see what element it renders, given\\nthe corresponding props. React will continue to do this until there are no more\\ncreateElement invocations which have a class or a function as their first\\nargument. Let’s take a look at this in action.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Button</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> React.createElement(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"button\\\"</span>,\\n    { <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>: addFriend },\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Add Friend\\\"</span>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">User</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ name, addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> React.createElement(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"div\\\"</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>,\\n    React.createElement(\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"p\\\"</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>,\\n      name\\n    ),\\n    React.createElement(Button, { addFriend })\\n  )\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Above we have two components. A Button and a User. User’s object representation\\nof the DOM will be a “div” with two children, a “p” which wraps the user’s name\\nand a Button component. Now let’s swap out the createElement invocations with\\nwhat they return,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Button</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'button'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>: addFriend,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Add Friend'</span>\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">User</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ name, addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'div'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: [\\n        {\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'p'</span>,\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n            <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: name\\n          }\\n        },\\n        {\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: Button,\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n            addFriend\\n          }\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You’ll notice in the above code we have four different type properties,\\n“button”, “div”, “p”, and Button. When React sees an element with a function or\\nclass type (like our <em>“type: Button”</em> above), it will then consult with that\\ncomponent to know which element it returns, given the corresponding props. With\\nthat in mind, at the end of this process, React has a full object representation\\nof the DOM tree. In our example, that will look like this,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'div'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: [\\n      {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'p'</span>,\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler McGinnis'</span>\\n        }\\n      },\\n      {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'button'</span>,\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>: addFriend,\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Add Friend'</span>\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This whole process is called reconciliation in React and it’s triggered every\\ntime setState or ReactDOM.render is called.</p>\\n<p>So now let’s again take a look at our initial question that sparked this blog\\npost,</p>\\n<figure>\\n  <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis33/status/771087982858113024\\\">\\n    <img style=\\\"margin: 0px auto; border-radius: 5px\\\" src='component-element.jpg' />\\n  </a>\\n</figure>\\n<p>At this point we have all the knowledge we need to answer this question except\\nfor one important piece. Odds are if you’ve been using React for any amount of\\ntime, you don’t use React.createElement to create your object representations of\\nthe DOM. Instead, you’re probably using JSX. Earlier I wrote “The primary reason\\nfor the confusion is that there’s an often un-talked about abstraction layer\\nbetween JSX and what’s actually going on in React land.”. This abstraction layer\\nis that <em>JSX is always going to get transpiled to React.createElement\\ninvocations (typically) via Babel.</em></p>\\n<p>Looking at our earlier example, this code</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Button</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> React.createElement(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"button\\\"</span>,\\n    { <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>: addFriend },\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Add Friend\\\"</span>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">User</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ name, addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> React.createElement(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"div\\\"</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>,\\n    React.createElement(\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"p\\\"</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>,\\n      name\\n    ),\\n    React.createElement(Button, { addFriend })\\n  )\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>is the result of this JSX being transpiled.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Button</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{addFriend}</span>&gt;</span>Add Friend<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">User</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ name, addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">p</span>&gt;</span>{name}<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">p</span>&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">addFriend</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{addFriend}/</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n  )\\n}\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>So finally, what do we call it when we write out our component like this,\\n<code>&lt;Icon/&gt;</code>?</p>\\n<p>We can call it “creating an element” because after the JSX is transpiled,\\nthat’s exactly what’s happening.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">React.createElement(Icon, <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>All of these examples, are “creating a React element”</p>\\n<pre><code>React.createElement(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'div'</span>, className: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'container'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Hello!'</span>)\\n\\n&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">div</span> className=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'container'</span>&gt;Hello!&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">div</span>&gt;\\n\\n&lt;Hello /&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>For more reading on this subject see <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/12/18/react-components-elements-and-instances.html\\\">“React Components, Instances, and Elements”</a> by Dan Abramov.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 459 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"React \\\"Aha\\\" Moments\",\"date\":\"2016-12-21T11:12:03.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/react-aha-moments/\",\"body\":\"<figure>\\n  <img style=\\\"margin: 0px auto; border-radius: 5px\\\" src='aha-small-min.jpg' />\\n</figure>\\n<p>One of my main goals whenever I’m teaching or writing technical content is to maximize “aha” moments.

Throughout that time I’ve been taking notes on what triggers these “aha” moments, specifically for learning React. About two weeks ago I came across <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/5gmywc/what_were_the_biggest_aha_moments_you_had_while/\\\">this Reddit thread</a> which had the same idea.

Your UI is a function of your state and props are to components what arguments are to functions.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>One of the best parts of React is that you can use the same intuition that you have about JavaScript functions for when and where you should create React components. However, instead of your function taking in some arguments and returning a value, your function is going to take in some arguments and return an object representation of your UI. This idea can be summed up in the following formula, fn(d) = V. A Function takes in some Data and returns a View. This is a beautiful way to think about developing user interfaces because now your UI is just composed of different function invocations. This is how you’re already used to building applications and now you can take advantage of all of the benefits of function composition when building UIs.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>In React, your entire application’s UI is built using function composition and JSX is an abstraction over those functions.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The most common reaction I see from first timers using React is “React seems cool, but I really don’t like JSX. It breaks my separation of concerns”. JSX isn’t trying to be HTML, and it’s definitely more than just a templating language. There are two important things to realize with JSX. First, <a href=\\\"https://tylermcginnis.com/react-elements-vs-react-components/\\\">JSX is an abstraction over <em>React.createElement</em></a> which is a function that returns an object representation of the DOM. I know that was wordy but the tl;dr is that whenever you write JSX, once it’s transpiled, you’ll have a JavaScript object which represents the actual DOM (or whatever View is representative of the platform you’re on, iOS, Android, etc). Then React is able to analyze that object, analyze the actual DOM, and by doing a diff, update the DOM only where a change occurred. This has some performance upsides to it but more importantly shows that JSX really is “just JavaScript”. Second, because JSX is just JavaScript, you get all the benefits that JavaScript provides (composition, linting, debugging) but still with the declarativeness (and familiarity) of HTML.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Components don’t necessary have to correspond to DOM nodes.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>When we first learn React we’re taught that “Components are the building blocks of React. They take in input and return some UI (descriptor)”. Does that mean that every component needs to directly return UI descriptors as we’re typically taught? What if we wanted to have a component render another component (Higher Order Component pattern)? What if we wanted a component to manage some slice of state and then instead of returning a UI descriptor, it returns a function invocation passing in the state (Render Props pattern)? What if we had a component that was in charge of managing sound rather than a visual UI, what would it return? What’s great about React is you don’t <strong>have</strong> to return typical “views” from your components. As long as what eventually gets returned is a React element, null, or false, you’re good.</p>\\n<p>You can return other components</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">render () {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">MyOtherComponent</span> /&gt;</span>\\n}\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>you can return function invocations</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">render () {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.props.children(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.someImportantState)\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>or, you can return nothing</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">render () {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>I really enjoyed Ryan Florence’s <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp-NOggyz54\\\">React Rally talk</a> where he covers this principle more in depth.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“When two components need to share state, I need to lift that state up instead of trying to keep their states in sync.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>A component based architecture naturally makes sharing state more difficult. If two components rely on the same state, where should that state live? This was such a popular question that it spurred an entire ecosystem of solutions which eventually ended with Redux. Redux’s solution is to put that shared state in another location called a “store”. Components can then subscribe to any portions of the store they need and can also dispatch “actions” to update the store. React’s solution is to find the nearest parent of both of those components and have that parent manage the shared state, passing it down to the child components as needed. There are pros and cons to both approaches but it’s important to be aware that both solutions exist.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Inheritance is unnecessary in React, and both containment and specialization can be achieved with composition.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>React has always been, for good reason, very liberal in adopting functional programming principles. A precedent move away from inheritance and towards composition was when the release of React 0.13 made it clear React wasn’t adding support for Mixins with ES6 classes. The reason for this is because mostly everything that can be accomplished with Mixins (or inheritance) can also be accomplished through composition, but with less side effects. If you’re coming to React from an inheritance heavy mindset, this new way of thinking may be difficult and probably won’t feel too natural. Luckily there are some great resources to help. <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMtDGfHWpA\\\">Here’s one</a> that’s not React specific that I’ve enjoyed.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“The separation of container and presentational components.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>If you think about the anatomy of a React component, it usually involves some state, potentially some lifecycle hooks, and markup via JSX. What if, instead of having all of that in one component, we separate the state and the lifecycle hooks from the markup. This leaves us with two components. The first has state, life cycle methods, and is responsible for how the component works. The second receives data via props and is responsible for how the component looks. This approach allows us to have better reusability of our presentational components since they’re no longer coupled to the data they receive. I’ve also found that it allows you (and newcomers to your project) to better understand the structure of your application. You’re able to swap out the implementation of a component without seeing or caring about the UI and vice versa - designers can tweak the UI without ever having to worry about how those presentational components are receiving data.</p>\\n<p><em>For more on this topic, check out <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.q9tui51xz\\\">Presentational and Container Components</a>.</em></p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“If you try to keep most of your component pure, stateless things become a lot simpler to maintain.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>This is another benefit of separating your presentational components from your container components. State is the sidekick of inconsistency.

If we wanted to create another “person” we would\\nhave to re-code the entire object like below.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> joey = {}; <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">//create an empty object</span>\\njoey.name = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Joey\\\"</span>; <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">//assign properties to that object</span>\\njoey.age = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">25</span>;\\njoey.homeState = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Arkansas\\\"</span>;\\njoey.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n   alert(joey.name);\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Obviously this technique is not very effective if we have large code bases that\\nare dealing with very similar objects.</p>\\n<p>Let’s not examine the Functional Instantiation technique for creating an\\nobject.<br> There really are two ways to do this, first:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age, homeState</span>)</span>{\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name,\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">age</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.age,\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">homeState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.homeState,\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">sayName</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n        alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name);\\n     }\\n   }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and the second way of writing this is</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age, homeState</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> results = {};\\n  results.name = name;\\n  results.age = age;\\n  results.homeState = homeState;\\n  results.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n   alert(results.name);\\n }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>That’s much better than what we had earlier. Now all we need to do to create a\\nnew object is</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Tyler = person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Tyler\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Utah\\\"</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Joey = person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Joey\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">25</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Arkansas\\\"</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This way is not only pretty on the eyes, it seems to flow better than other\\ntechniques and you’re able to have real “private” variables if you set up your\\nclosure functions correctly. This isn’t possible on other the other techniques\\nI’m going to talk about.</p>\\n<p>Next we have Functional Instantiation with Shared Methods.<br> You’ll notice\\nabove that every time we call the person function, we’re creating a new\\nsayName() function. Why not just create another object outside out function,\\nthen create a sayName property of that object then reference that new object\\nevery time we want to use sayName?</p>\\n<p>Let’s see what this looks like below.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age, homeState</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> results = {};\\n  results.name = name;\\n  results.age = age;\\n  results.homeState = homeState;\\n  results.sayName = personMethod.sayName;\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> personMethod = {};\\npersonMethod.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name);\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">//later</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Tyler = person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Tyler\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Utah\\\"</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Joey = person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Joey\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">25</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Arkansas\\\"</span>);\\n\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now whenever we call the person function, we’re referencing that\\npersonMethod.sayName method rather than creating a new one each time.<br> Now is\\nwhen things start to get a little tricky.</p>\\n<p>Prototypical Instantiation is another way to create an object.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age, homeState</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> result = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Object</span>.create(person.prototype);\\n  result.name     = name;\\n  result.age  = age;\\n  result.homeState = homeState;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> result;\\n};\\n\\nperson.prototype.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.sayName);\\n};\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Later</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> tyler = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Tyler\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Utah\\\"</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> joey = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Joey\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">25</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Arkansas\\\"</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In the code above, the result variable is now able to delegate to\\nperson.prototype on failed look-ups. For example, when we say person.sayName(),\\nthe browser checks for sayName on the person object, doesn’t find it, so it\\ndelegates to the prototype, where it is found and returned.</p>\\n<p>Now let’s analyze the most common approach: Pseudo Classical Instantiation</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age, homeState</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">/* this = Object.create(Car.prototype) */</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name     = name;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.age  = age;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.homeState = homeState;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">/* return this */</span>\\n};\\n\\nperson.prototype.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.sayName);\\n};\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Later</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> tyler = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Tyler\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Utah\\\"</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> joey = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Joey\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">25</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Arkansas\\\"</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So what’s going on here is that first, whenever we use the “new” keyword,\\nCar.prototype is set to be the delegator of the “this” variable whenever a call\\non the “this” variable fails. For example, when we say this.sayName(), the\\nbrowser first checks the person function for “sayName”, when it’s not found, (or\\nwhen it fails to find it), it delegates to the prototype, which then alerts\\nthis.sayName. This allows our function to be more flexible and really utilize\\nthe “this” keyword. Also, you’ll notice that since “this” is automatically added\\nand returned, there is no need to return that object since it’s already doing\\nthat for us. This technique is the industry standard and should be used in most\\ncases (unless you prefer functional instantiation).</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2013-08-08-object-creation-in-javascript/index.md\n// module id = 433\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Steps to Implementing an Algorithm\",\"date\":\"2013-08-10T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/steps-to-implementing-an-algorithm-5714c47c579d/\",\"body\":\"<p>In order to understand how to implement an Algorithm, we first need to\\nconceptually understand what an Algorithm is.

My schema for Mongo involves a\\nTitle, Question, Parameter, and Answer. When a user clicks submit, an ng-click\\nevent is fired, I then take the code that was in his or her editor, parse it to\\nbe in the correct format, pass in the Parameter from the DB, evaluate it, then\\ncompare the result to the actual answer.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://Socket.IO\\\">Socket.IO</a> is the main contributor of this application. I used Sockets in order\\nto keep a constant live stream going between both users and their editors.</p>\\n<h4>Challenges</h4>\\n<p>It’s a weird feeling when you’re about to start a really big project. Although\\nI’ve worked on Web Apps in the past, none of them have been this big. When I\\nstarted this project I had put up huge mental barriers. I thought I didn’t know\\nenough, I had no idea how I was going to take this awesome idea I had in my head\\nand actually create it. I could, and one day probably will, write a whole blog\\npost on overcoming mental barriers in Software Engineering. The secret? Well,\\nyou kind of just have to trust what you know and understand you’re going to fail\\na lot, but it’s in overcoming that failure that you’ll succeed. During the full\\nphase of the project I probably hit about 5–6 walls where I thought, ‘I really\\ndon’t know what to do now’ or ‘I really don’t know how to solve this particular\\nproblem’. However, with the looming two week deadline we had quickly\\napproaching, I had no time to just debug for 2–3 days and figure it out. I had\\nto do what was very, very difficult for me to do, forget the problem and have\\nfaith that eventually I would read something or run into the solution at another\\ntime. This is exactly what happened — every single time. One example of this is\\nI spent the entire day two Saturdays ago trying to figure out why my initial\\nModal was freezing and crashing chrome. I literally spent all day trying to\\nfigure it out. I was sure my\\n<a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18808295/closing-an-angular-ui-modal-on-a-socketio-event\\\">problem</a>\\nwas with Angular in that for some reason when I tried to hide the Modal, it\\nwasn’t working. Then I later realized that <a href=\\\"http://Socket.IO\\\">Socket.IO</a> was making a <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18815843/socket-io-event-being-triggered-twice\\\">Double\\nConnection</a>\\nwhich throwing everything off in my <a href=\\\"http://Socket.IO\\\">Socket.IO</a> rooms. I spent all day debugging\\nthen finally had to just move on. About 3 days later I was having similar issues\\non another section of my site. I then figured out that I was declaring my\\nController in both my HTML <code>&lt;div ng-controller = ‘myCntrl’&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> and in my\\n$routeProvider. This is the reason that everything was being triggered twice\\nwhich was then freezing my modal. By deleting one line in my code, I fixed two\\nvery big bugs I was facing.</p>\\n<p>As a whole, the biggest problems I faced were definitely related to Sockets and\\nmore specifically the use of rooms with sockets. For every connection that is\\nmade, I categorize that user into a specific room based on a certain algorithm.\\nBeing a live game, the user has the option to stay, disconnect, or refresh. This\\nleads to a vast array or certain behavior that could happen in one specific\\nroom. This behavior needed to be somehow connected with other rooms and the\\nbehavior of the users in that room. For example, if there are two rooms each\\ncontaining two users, the game needs to be able to detect if both rooms have\\nsomeone disconnect, and then pair those remaining users.</p>\\n<h4>The Outcome</h4>\\n<p>Overall, I’m very pleased with what I’ve created and I’ve received pretty good\\nfeedback so far. One of my <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/jakelingwall\\\">really good\\nfriends</a> back in Utah works at\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.domo.com/\\\">Domo</a> and was able to show off CoderCombat to a few of\\nthe developers there. One in particular is a guy I’ve looked up to for a while\\nnow and is probably the best developer in Utah under 30 (Merrick Christensen).\\nHe played Coder Combat and said “This is awesome. I’m impressed”. I was on\\nCloud-9 all morning yesterday. Although kind of weird, it’s an amazing feeling\\nwhen developers you really look up to enjoy the Software you build.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*v6n7OB2uBLwBXO0k.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2013-10-01-coder-combat/index.md\n// module id = 435\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Why Every Athlete Should Become a Software Engineer\",\"date\":\"2013-10-01T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/why-every-athlete-should-become-a-software-engineer-a9bfa0a59ca2/\",\"body\":\"<p>Until I was about 19 years old, basketball was my entire life. When I say\\nentire, I mean it was just about all I thought about and all I ever wanted to\\ndo. In my yearbook for senior year I still laugh when I see the ‘description’ I\\nput for myself under my name. I quote, ‘uhh…basketball?’. To me, basketball had\\nthree great assets. First, I could become as good as I wanted to become. The\\nonly thing holding me back was my personal dedication to improving myself.\\nSecond, people admire those things that you can do but they think they can’t do\\nthemselves. And third, you’re only as good as the team you’re on. Like all kids\\ngrowing up, I had big dreams of where basketball would take me. I understood\\nthat in order to play at a collegiate level, I needed to sacrifice things others\\nwouldn’t. I was known for being the kid who was always in the gym and always\\nimproving. Going into my senior year of basketball all my plans came to a\\nscreeching halt. While playing a pick-up game I tore my meniscus. Long story\\nshort, after a few months on crutches I ended up recovering for the first game\\nof the season but I was never the same. Once you have a knee surgery it’s hard\\nto tell your body that your knee is fine and to trust it. I had a pretty good\\nseason but not one of a future collegiate player. Junior year my team won state\\nbut senior year we came up short. It was a terrible way to end a ‘career’ and I\\nhad dreams about that last game for over a year when I was done. I spent a few\\nyears as a missionary and getting lost in helping others and learning Spanish\\nwas an amazing experience, but I still missed basketball and I still felt a\\nweird void in my life.</p>\\n<p>I’m still not sure what really got me into creating software, but the idea of\\nbeing able to create an emotional experience for people using nothing more than\\na text editor and an internet connection really fascinated me. When I started\\nprogramming, I was convinced I would never find a pursuit that I could really\\nlose myself in as much as I did basketball. I was wrong.</p>\\n<p>Basketball, and sports in general, give you the ability to become as good as you\\nwant to be. The barrier to entry is pretty low with basketball. You need a hoop,\\nand a ball. Hoops are everywhere and basketballs are cheap. You’re the only one\\nstanding in your way from becoming a great basketball player. Software is the\\nsame. Now more than ever there are so many tutorials, video lectures, and just\\nawesome resources for learning how to develop. To quote a favorite line of mine\\nabout the power of knowledge vs education, “ See, the sad thing about a guy like\\nyou is in 50 years you’re gonna start doing some thinking on your own and you’re\\ngonna come up with the fact that there are two certaintees in life. One, don’t\\ndo that. And Two, you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on a f&amp;$^%#* education\\nyou could of got for a dollar fifty in late charges at the public library.” This\\nquote directly applies to the state of online resources that exist. Education is\\nexpensive, but knowledge is free. You’re the only one holding yourself back from\\nbecoming an amazing developer.</p>\\n<p>There is something very gratifying in doing something that other people think\\nyou’re not capable of doing. Basketball players and athletes in general are\\nabsolutely amazing to someone who has never picked up a ball or tried to do\\nanything athletic. Watch some professional snowboarders then try to ride down\\nthe hill for the first time and you’ll instantly gain a huge respect and\\nadmiration for them. The same is true with Software Engineers. To those who\\ndon’t code, what we do is absolutely amazing. One of the biggest websites in our\\nday was made from a basic PHP form in a University dorm room. It’s obviously\\nscaled quite a bit from there but in it’s basic form Facebook is something that\\nan entry level developer can create in a few weeks. Software Engineering made me\\nfeel admired and almost magical in what I could create.</p>\\n<p>Last, but not least, as an individual athlete, you’re nothing without your team.\\nThroughout all of sports, this is the main thing everyone has learned. Now, can\\nyou imagine where our industry would be without the emergence of open source\\nprojects? No jQuery, no Angular, no Backbone, no Node, no Rails. This industry\\nis so amazing because of those people who didn’t care about pulling a profit.\\nThat’s what I love about Software Engineering. I find pure joy and satisfaction\\nfrom creating an app that those developers I look up to can enjoy. That someone\\nI’ve never met before can find joy and have an emotional experience with\\nsomething I built in my spare time is so exciting to me. Although I still love\\nbasketball and play it from time to time, becoming the best Software Engineer I\\ncan become is perhaps the most fulfilling pursuit I’ve come across in my life\\nand I think every athlete who experiences the same void I did should consider\\nfollowing the path I took.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2013-10-01-why-every-athlete-should-become-software-engineer/index.md\n// module id = 436\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Categorizing Sockets and Broadcasting to Rooms with Socket.IO\",\"date\":\"2013-10-02T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/categorizing-sockets-and-broadcasting-to-rooms-with-socket-io-27d6a57b4b96/\",\"body\":\"<p>The idea and execution of creating ‘Rooms’ with <a href=\\\"http://Socket.IO\\\">Socket.IO</a> and only emitting an\\nevent to users in that specific room is documented as overly complex, but it\\ndoesn’t have to be.

Then that specific Sockets room can be accessed and\\nseen by doing io.sockets.clients(‘roomName’). Although convenient, I actually\\nfound that keeping track of rooms in this matter was frustrating because there\\nare a lot more methods and properties that each socket had so it crowded what I\\nactually cared about, which was the room.

Now, I had this convenient\\nobject that basically mirrors the overly complex Object that <a href=\\\"http://Socket.IO\\\">Socket.IO</a> kept for\\nme. Once you actually have the desired amount of users in a room, emitting\\nevents to only those users is simple. Here’s the run down.</p>\\n<p><code>io.sockets.in(‘roomName’).emit();</code> This emits whatever you want to ALL users who\\nare in the room ‘roomName’.</p>\\n<p><code>socket.broadcast.to(‘roomName’).emit()</code> This\\nemits whatever you want to every user in ‘roomName’ EXCEPT FOR the sender.</p>\\n<p>Although you probably won’t use it, io.sockets.emit() emits an event to all\\nsockets connected to the server.</p>\\n<p>Last but not least <code>socket.broadcast.emit()</code>\\nemits whatever to all sockets connected to the server except for the socket\\nsending the request.</p>\\n<p>That’s really it. You just add a room property\\nto every socket, create a roomList object to keep track of which rooms every is\\nin, then you broadcast and event to only the room you want to receive that\\nevent.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2013-10-02-categorizing-sockets/index.md\n// module id = 437\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"AngularJS: Factory vs Service vs Provider\",\"date\":\"2014-05-04T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/angularjs-factory-vs-service-vs-provider-5f426cfe6b8c/\",\"body\":\"<p>When you first get started with Angular, you’ll naturally find yourself flooding\\nyour controllers and scopes with unnecessary logic. It’s important to realize\\nearly on that your controller should be very thin; meaning, most of the business\\nlogic and persistent data in your application should be taken care of or stored\\nin a service. I see a few questions a day on Stack Overflow regarding someone\\ntrying to have persistent data in his or her controller. That’s just not the\\npurpose of a controller. For memory purposes, controllers are instantiated only\\nwhen they are needed and discarded when they are not. Because of this, every\\ntime you switch a route or reload a page, Angular cleans up the current\\ncontroller.

Then when you pass the factory\\ninto your controller, those properties on the object will now be available in\\nthat controller through your factory.

We then set\\nproperties on our $scope object that are coming from data from ‘myFactory’. The\\nonly tricky code above is if you’ve never dealt with promises before. Because\\ncallItunes is returning a promise, we are able to use the .then() method and\\nonly set $scope.data.artistData once our promise is fulfilled with the iTunes\\ndata. You’ll notice our controller is very ‘thin’.

For you JavaScript gurus this\\nshould give you a big hint into the nature of the code. For those of you with a\\nlimited background in JavaScript or for those who aren’t too familiar with what\\nthe ‘new’ keyword actually does, let’s review some JavaScript fundamentals that\\nwill eventually help us in understanding the nature of a Service.</p>\\n<p>To really see the changes that occur when you invoke a function with the ‘new’\\nkeyword, let’s create a function and invoke it with the ‘new’ keyword, then\\nlet’s show what the interpreter does when it sees the ‘new’ keyword. The end\\nresults will both be the same.</p>\\n<p>First let’s create our Constructor.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name = name;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.age = age;\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This is a typical JavaScript constructor function. Now whenever we invoke the\\nPerson function using the ‘new’ keyword, ‘this’ will be bound to the newly\\ncreated object.</p>\\n<p>Now let’s add a method onto our Person’s prototype so it will be available on\\nevery instance of our Person ‘class’.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">Person.prototype.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'My name is '</span> + <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name)\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now, because we put the sayName function on the prototype, every instance of\\nPerson will be able to call the sayName function in order alert that instance’s\\nname.</p>\\n<p>Now that we have our Person constructor function and our sayName function on its\\nprototype, let’s actually create an instance of Person then call the sayName\\nfunction.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> tyler = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> Person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>);\\ntyler.sayName() <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// alerts 'My name is Tyler'</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So all together the code for creating a Person constructor, adding a function to\\nit’s prototype, creating a Person instance, and then calling the function on its\\nprototype looks like this.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name = name;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.age = age;\\n}\\n\\nPerson.prototype.sayName = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'My name is '</span> + <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name)\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> tyler = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> Person(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">23</span>);\\ntyler.sayName() <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// alerts 'My name is Tyler'</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now let’s look at what actually is happening when you use the ‘new’ keyword in\\nJavaScript. First thing you should notice is that after using ‘new’ in our\\nexample, we’re able to call a method (sayName) on ‘tyler’ just as if it were an\\nobject — that’s because it is. So first, we know that our Person constructor is\\nreturning an object, whether we can see that in the code or not. Second, we know\\nthat because our sayName function is located on the prototype and not directly\\non the Person instance, the object that the Person function is returning must be\\ndelegating to its prototype on failed lookups. In more simple terms, when we\\ncall tyler.sayName() the interpreter says “OK, I’m going to look on the ‘tyler’\\nobject we just created, locate the sayName function, then call it. Wait a\\nminute, I don’t see it here — all I see is name and age, let me check the\\nprototype. Yup, looks like it’s on the prototype, let me call it.”.</p>\\n<p>Below is code for how you can think about what the ‘new’ keyword is actually\\ndoing in JavaScript. It’s basically a code example of the above paragraph. I’ve\\nput the ‘interpreter view’ or the way the interpreter sees the code inside of\\nnotes.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Person = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">name, age</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// The next line creates an object that will</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// delegate to the person's prototype on failed lookups.</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">//var obj = Object.create(Person.prototype);</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// The next line sets 'this' to the newly created object</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// this = obj;</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.name = name;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.age = age;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// return this;</span>\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now having this knowledge of what the ‘new’ keyword really does in JavaScript,\\ncreating a Service in Angular should be easier to understand now.</p>\\n<p>The biggest thing to understand when creating a Service is knowing that Services\\nare instantiated with the ‘new’ keyword. Combining that knowledge with our\\nexamples above, you should now recognize that you’ll be attaching your\\nproperties and methods directly to ‘this’ which will then be returned from the\\nService itself. Let’s take a look at this in action.</p>\\n<p>Unlike what we originally did with the Factory example, we don’t need to create\\nan object then return that object because, like mentioned many times before, we\\nused the ‘new’ keyword so the interpreter will create that object, have it\\ndelegate to it’s prototype, then return it for us without us having to do the\\nwork.</p>\\n<p>First things first, let’s create our ‘private’ and helper function. This should\\nlook very familiar since we did the exact same thing with our factory. I won’t\\nexplain what each line does here because I did that in the factory example, if\\nyou’re confused, re-read the factory example.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">app.service(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'myService'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">$http, $q</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> baseUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term='</span>;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _artist = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _finalUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> makeUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    _artist = _artist.split(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">' '</span>).join(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'+'</span>);\\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'</span>;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> _finalUrl;\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now, we’ll attach all of our methods that will be available in our controller to\\n‘this’.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">app.service(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'myService'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">$http, $q</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> baseUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term='</span>;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _artist = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _finalUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> makeUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    _artist = _artist.split(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">' '</span>).join(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'+'</span>);\\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'</span>;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> _finalUrl;\\n  }\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.setArtist = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">artist</span>) </span>{\\n    _artist = artist;\\n  }\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.getArtist = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> _artist;\\n  }\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.callItunes = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    makeUrl()\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> deferred = $q.defer();\\n    $http({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">method</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'JSONP'</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">url</span>: _finalUrl\\n    }).success(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">data</span>) </span>{\\n      deferred.resolve(data);\\n    }).error(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n      deferred.reject(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'There was an error'</span>);\\n    })\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> deferred.promise;\\n  }\\n\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now just like in our factory, setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes will be\\navailable in whichever controller we pass myService into.

This is of\\nhuge importance if you’re needing to alter some portion of your service object\\nbefore it’s available everywhere else in your application. Although very similar\\nto Services/Factories, there are a few differences which we’ll discuss.</p>\\n<p>First we set up our Provider in a similar way we did with our Service and\\nFactory. The variables below are our ‘private’ and helper function.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">app.provider(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'myProvider'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">$http, $q</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> baseUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term='</span>;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _artist = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _finalUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Going to set this property on the config fn below</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.thingFromConfig = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>;\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> makeUrl = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    _artist = _artist.split(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">' '</span>).join(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'+'</span>);\\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'</span>;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> _finalUrl;\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><em>Again if any portion of the above code is confusing, check out the Factory\\nsection where I explain what it all does it greater details.</em></p>\\n<p>You can think of Providers as having three sections. The first section is the\\n‘private’ variables/functions that will be modified/set later (shown above). The\\nsecond section is the variables/functions that will be available in your\\napp.config function and are therefore available to alter before they’re\\navailable anywhere else (also shown above). It’s important to note that those\\nvariables need to be attached to the ‘this’ keyword. In our example, only\\n‘thingFromConfig’ will be available to alter in the app.config. The third\\nsection (shown below) is all the variables/functions that will be available in\\nyour controller when you pass in the ‘myProvider’ service into that specific\\ncontroller.</p>\\n<p>When creating a service with Provider, the only properties/methods that will be\\navailable in your controller are those properties/methods which are returned\\nfrom the $get() function. The code below puts $get on ‘this’ (which we know will\\neventually be returned from that function). Now, that $get function returns all\\nthe methods/properties we want to be available in the controller. Here’s a code\\nexample.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.$get = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span

The\\nnot so obvious conclusion, however, is what exactly you should program and what\\nlanguage you should learn to program. Society enjoys grouping programmers\\ntogether as if we’re all just movers of bits. Although technically true, we must\\nremember that although an airplane moves people and a mover moves furniture,\\nthey both serve two different purposes and both attempt to accomplish different\\ngoals. Thus is the same with programmers and programming languages. If a\\nJavaScript engineer is the airplane, a Ruby engineer is the mover. At a\\nfundamental level they do the same thing, but their goals and how they\\naccomplish those goals are drastically different. When deciding which language\\nto learn, you first should decide what your current and future goals are, then\\npick which language will help you arrive at those goals.</p>\\n<p>When I first started learning to program I had three goals. One, I wanted to\\nbuild web applications. When I was five years old, there were 45 million, or\\nalmost 1% of the world population using the internet. Now, not even twenty years\\nlater, there are 2.9 billion internet users composing 40% of the world’s\\npopulation. The internet has and will continue to define my generation and\\ngenerations to come and I wanted to be apart of that movement. Two, I wanted to\\nlearn something that would continue to be relevant into the future and one that\\nwould continue to progress and mature. I love learning. Learning makes me happy.\\nI wanted a programming language that would never stagnate so my skills wouldn’t\\nstagnant along with it. Three, if I had an idea, or someone else had an idea I\\nbelieved in, I wanted to have the skills to build it. We are living in a time\\nwhere you can connect with 2.9 billion people while your cost of goods sold is\\nnegligible. While weighing all of these options, the language that won in every\\ncategory was JavaScript.</p>\\n<p>If you’re a Software Engineer who has been under a rock for the last five years,\\nyou still think of JavaScript as a dinky scripting language which helps change a\\nbutton’s color when you mouse over it. That couldn’t be further from the truth.\\nJavaScript has very quickly progressed into a powerful language for building web\\napplications, think Gmail or PayPal. JavaScript is the ‘language of the web’,\\nand as talked about earlier — that’s a great thing. The web is everywhere, on\\nyour computer, phone, in your car and it’s continuing to swallow the world. But\\nwhat makes JavaScript even more interesting now is we’ve built tools that allow\\nus to write JavaScript code in more than just a web browser.</p>\\n<p>There are typically two types of programmers for the web. Front-end Engineers\\nand back-end Engineers. Front-end engineers work typically in HTML, CSS, and\\nJavaScript and they make web applications look pretty while also sending\\nrequests to the ‘back-end’ in order to receive different types of data. Think\\nFacebook. When you click the thumbs up icon, the browser (or front-end) notices\\nyou clicked the icon, it will then tell the back-end “Hey, Tyler likes Mikenzi’s\\npost about her dog, make sure that gets saved somewhere”. If everything went\\nwell, the back-end responds with “Sounds good, that information has been saved”.\\nAt a very high level that’s how the web works. It’s the back-end engineers role\\nto write code that listens for requests from the front-end, and responds\\naccordingly. JavaScript used to be a language for front-end engineers only.\\nHowever, with the invention of Node.js, JavaScript can, and is very often used\\n(Wal-mart, PayPal), as a back-end language. This was huge for JavaScript\\nengineers. Now instead of having to learn a whole different language to write\\nback-end code, JavaScript engineers can stick to what they’re good at,\\nJavaScript. Right now you might be thinking, “well that’s cool, but I’m a big\\nbeliever in iPhone or Android apps and I think that’s the future”. Though you’re\\nwrong, here’s why you should still learn JavaScript. Believe it or not, **you\\ncan write iPhone apps or Android apps using JavaScript and submit those apps to\\nthe Apps Store. There’s a technology called Phonegap (<a href=\\\"http://phonegap.com/\\\">http://phonegap.com/</a>) that\\nallows you to take your JavaScript code, and wrap it in a iPhone or Android app.\\n**Though your Phonegap application is going to lack the performance of native\\niPhone apps (which is why iPhone app developers still have very nice jobs), it’s\\ncomforting to know if you wanted to build an iPhone app with JavaScript, you\\ncould. It’s as if Gandalf the White was able to take over Dumbledore’s\\nHeadmaster position at Hogwarts when he died. You get the best of both worlds.\\nCan you now see why JavaScript won’t be going anywhere anytime soon? It’s too\\nembedded into our daily lives. Even with Apple’s release of their new\\nprogramming language “Swift”, Apple is taking a steps away from C like languages\\nand a step closer to JavaScript like languages — which is fantastic news for\\nJavaScript developers.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*34M01dsNfyFG8z4k.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Still don’t believe me? Above is a graph of the amount of new repositories (code\\nbases) created on Github (a web app where programmers can save their code) by\\nyear. JavaScript is consistently at the top of lists like this because it’s\\neverywhere and it continues to progress and grow. Python, a language taught at\\nUniversities throughout the country was once a staple as a back-end language.\\nHowever, with the rise of different technologies like Node.js and Google’s\\nnewest back-end language ‘Go’, Python is quickly becoming a language that’s\\ntaught in academia but not used in the real world. You don’t want to learn a\\nlanguage that’s trending down. JavaScript is the George Clooney of programming\\nlanguages. It gets better with age.</p>\\n<p>Although we’ve covered a lot, there’s one important fact about JavaScript that I\\nstill haven’t mentioned that makes it perfect for people who are learning\\noutside the normal confinement of academia. JavaScript is very rarely taught in\\nacademia, and if it is, it’s uncomfortably bad. Professors still hold strong to\\nthe notion of JavaScript as a dinky scripting language, which their students\\nthen reflect going forward with their careers. This is terrible if you’re in\\nacademia (or care at all about how our education system is constantly behind\\nwhen it comes to technology, which you should). But if you’re learning outside\\nof academia, this is a huge advantage to JavaScript. You’re not directly\\ncompeting with the tens of thousands of students studying Computer Science. This\\nmakes finding a job a whole lot easier.</p>\\n<p>JavaScript has changed, and will continue to change, the way we interact with\\ntechnology. Like the 2015 Cleveland Cavaliers, it’s ok if you jump on the\\nbandwagon, because everybody is doing it.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2014-08-15-js-george-clooney-of-programming-languages/index.md\n// module id = 439\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Book Review: JavaScript Patterns (4.5/5)\",\"date\":\"2014-09-15T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/book-review-javascript-patterns-4-5-5-cc1f22efc4e7/\",\"body\":\"<p>As someone already very familiar with the JavaScript landscape, it’s difficult\\nto find a book that’s at the right level.

In the\\nfirst chapter of the book, Stoyan does a fantastic job of covering some\\nfundamental JavaScript principles that are often glanced over. ‘this’, the new\\nkeyword, hoisting, and closures to name a few. After covering the fundamentals\\nStoyan jumps straight into some very interesting design patterns in JavaScript.\\nAs someone coming from a non traditional CS background, it was great to see\\nsomeone take famous design patterns like Singletons, Factories, Proxies, and\\nDecorators and apply them in JavaScript. Though some might complain that this\\nbook is a tad outdated, I actually think that adds to its strength. Many times\\nwe rely on things like bind and Object.create in ES5 but because ES5 was newly\\nreleased when this book was created, Stoyan doesn’t assume you’re going to use\\nits features but does assume you’ll want to shim some of its features for older\\nbrowsers. This sheds an interesting light on how some of these patterns in ES5\\nwere created. For example, Object.create is recreated in like this,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>(!<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Object</span>.create){\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Object</span>.create = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">obj</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> F = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{};\\n    F.prototype = obj;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> F;\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Also, Function.prototype.bind is doing something similar to this under the hood</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">typeof</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Function</span>.prototype.bind === <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'undefined'</span>){\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Function</span>.prototype.bind = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">thisArg</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> fn = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> slice = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Array</span>.prototype.slice;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> args = slice.call(<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">arguments</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>);\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> fn.apply(thisArg, args.concat(slice.call(<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">arguments</span>)));\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Overall, JavaScript Patterns by Stoyan Stefanov is a fantastic book for someone\\nwith prior JavaScript experience who is looking to dive deeper into different\\nJavaScript patterns and how the language works.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2014-09-15-book-review-js-patterns/index.md\n// module id = 440\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"The Success of Firebase: An Outsider’s Perspective\",\"date\":\"2014-10-21T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/the-success-of-firebase-an-outsiders-perspective-7dffe0a60778/\",\"body\":\"<p>Regardless of what your opinion is of the Firebase/Google acquisition, what\\nAndrew, James, and the rest of the Firebase team have been able to accomplish\\nthese last few years have been nothing short of impressive. As an outsider and\\n(self proclaimed) advocate of Firebase, here’s my opinions on why Firebase was\\nable to accomplish what they did.</p>\\n<p>First, and the obvious point, Firebase is a fantastic product. I’m the lead\\ninstructor at a ‘Learn to Code’ bootcamp. Firebase is such an easy sell.\\nCreating brand advocates is easy when you have a product that is solving a\\nrather large pain point while also adding more features on top of it. For\\nexample, an often overlooked feature of Firebase is Facebook/Google/Custom\\nauthentication. It’s dead simple. Also for anyone who has used AngularFire, you\\nknow how well Angular and Firebase work together. Three way data binding is like\\nwhen Taco Bell joined forces with Doritos. Separated they’re great but when they\\ncombine, you start to look at the world differently. React and Firebase are also\\nfantastic together (but because I have no other analogy to represent anything\\nbetter than TacoBell and Doritos, I won’t attempt another).</p>\\n<p>Second, the Firebase team has done an impressive job at putting themselves out\\nthere and are very involved in the developer community. I spent a summer out in\\nSan Francisco last year. This is when I first discovered Firebase and met some\\nof their team. Out of all the Meetups I went to, there was a Firebase\\nrepresentative at every one (minus the Meteor meetup…for obvious reasons). I’m\\nfairly confident the Firebase team figured out a way to clone their employees.\\nSara, developer advocate, is everywhere — and always happy. Regardless if she is\\nactually a real person or not, she and many others have managed to put a face to\\ntheir software. I moved back to Utah after my stay in San Francisco and I was\\npleasantly surprised that the Firebase community in Utah was just as strong as\\nthe one in San Francisco. In fact, there were bigger advocates of Firebase in\\nUtah than those I met in SF.</p>\\n<p>Third, hustle. I know ‘hustle’ can have an almost derogatory meaning, but when\\nit comes to a scrappy startup, I would argue it’s a good thing. This kind of\\nties in with the ‘Firebase is everywhere’ comment from earlier. I talked with\\nAlex the VP of User Experience last year and he mention their goal at Firebase\\nis to ‘fundamentally change the internet’. That’s a rather large goal but\\neveryone there realizes that and they’ve all drunk (or dranken? drank maybe?)\\nthe KoolAid, if you will. Every release they’ve done, whether it’s updating the\\ndocs, AngularFire 0.8, or adding hosting has been followed by extreme support\\nfrom the developer community — even on HN where <a href=\\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4396747.\\\">people hate you by default\\nunless you tell them you hate them\\nfirst</a> (JK HN. We’re cool,\\nright?). Because they’re so involved in the community, they’ve understood what\\ntheir product was lacking and how to fix it, then they executed.</p>\\n<p>Fourth, social media (also Hustle). Have you ever mentioned anything about\\nFirebase on twitter? At nights when I’m lonely and feeling down, I tweet\\nsomething about Firebase. Each tweet is guaranteed to get at least 15% of the\\nFirebase team to favorite it. Really, checkout <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis33/status/461275369924853761\\\">this\\ntweet</a>. 16\\nFavorites. 7 Retweets. I don’t care who you are, if you’re pulling in 7 retweets\\nwith a tweet, that’s going to make the girl who dumped you and got married 3\\nmonths later question her decision.</p>\\n<p>Fifth, a very talented but down to earth team. Being a big supporter of Firebase\\nI’ve gotten to know some of the team on a ~first name basis. They genuinely care\\nabout their developers and (don’t send me Google hate tweets for this line) have\\ntheir developers best interests in mind. During my time in San Francisco when my\\nWife and I were deciding where we wanted to end up (Salt Lake vs SF) I\\ninterviewed at Firebase. Although I didn’t get an offer, it was one of the most\\npleasant interview experiences I had. Alex (VP of UX) responded very\\nprofessionally and listed how my experience didn’t align with what they were\\nlooking for at that time. Though hard to swallow, it was totally fair and he\\nlisted out all the facts so it wasn’t really debatable. As the norm Alex wished\\nme the best and told me to keep in touch. Six months later I received an email\\nfrom Alex asking me how I was doing in Utah, where I ended up working, and if I\\nwas ever in SF to let him know and we would grab lunch. Turns out I was going to\\nSF the next week so as I was there Alex, myself, and the UI team grabbed lunch.\\nIt’s that kind of attitude selfless mentality that, as an outsider, radiates\\nfrom the inside out from their product to their employees.</p>\\n<p>I realize this post is super fanboy’ish, but it’s partly because I am a fan boy.\\nThough Google doesn’t have the best track record, I’m not (as of 10/21/14)\\nconcerned about them ruining the product. For me, Firebase has been more than\\nlightning fast three way data binding magic, and unless Google does something\\nexponentially (or 2^n time complexity) bad — it can’t take that away.</p>\\n<p>ps. *So it turns out that James Tamplin (Firebase CEO) looks uncomfortably similar\\nto Ryan Key (Yellowcard lead singer). If this is indeed not a coincidence and\\nthey are in fact the same person, disregard this article. My love of Yellowcard\\nas a 13 year old boy has clouded my judgement of good software.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*sO3NB7mjKxpDjxOA.\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2014-10-21-success-of-firebase/index.md\n// module id = 441\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"React Tutorial Pt 1: A Comprehensive Guide to Building Apps with React.js\",\"date\":\"2015-01-12T08:14:05.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/react-js-tutorial-pt-1-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react-js-8ce321b125ba/\",\"body\":\"<hide-from-preview>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Table of Contents:</p>\\n<p><strong><a href=\\\"http://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/\\\">Pt I: A Comprehensive Guide to Building Apps with\\nReact.js.</a></strong></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://tylermcginnis.com/react-js-tutorial-1-5-utilizing-webpack-and-babel-to-build-a-react-js-app/\\\">Pt 1.5: Utilizing Webpack and Babel to build a React.js\\nApp</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-pt-2-building-react-applications-with-gulp-and-browserify/\\\">Pt II: Building React.js Apps with Gulp, and\\nBrowserify.</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-pt-iii-architecting-react-js-apps-with-flux/\\\">Pt III: Architecting React.js Apps with\\nFlux.</a></p>\\n<p><s>Pt IV: Add Routing to your React App with React Router.

There has never been a better time to take the leap and\\nstart learning React. The difficulty starting out with React isn’t React itself.\\nIt’s important to remember React is “just the V in MVC” or “just the view\\nlayer”. Comparing React to Angular or React to Ember is unfair because React\\nisn’t trying to be a full fledged framework. It’s just trying to be the view\\nlayer, which it’s really good at. This brings up issues for developers who are\\ntrying to learn React. React isn’t difficult to learn; putting all of the pieces\\ntogether to build a full web application in React is.</p>\\n<p>As you’ve started to learn React you’ve probably ran into this problem. You read\\nfacebook’s documentation, read a few tutorials, maybe even watched some Egghead\\nvideos. You started feeling pretty comfortable with React. Then you realized “I\\nfeel comfortable with React, but I still don’t think I can actually build\\nanything meaningful with it”. I think that’s a thought that everyone learning\\nReact has. This goes back to the point of React. If you just learned the “V” in\\nMVC, you would still feel pretty worthless. This React.js tutorial series is\\ngoing to focus on addressing that concern. We’re going to first start off\\nlearning about the fundamentals of React. You’ll get comfortable with React\\nitself from props to state to JSX and everything in between. After learning\\nabout the fundamentals of React we’re going to jump into all of the other\\ncomponents (pun slightly intended) that are needed to build a full web\\napplication using React.js. We’ll cover how to use Gulpto set up a nice build\\nprocess for converting React’s HTML like syntax called JSX to JavaScript. We’ll\\ntalk about using Browserify to tie all of our components together. We’ll then\\ndive into the Flux architecture and see how Flux can help us structure and\\narchitect our React application in an efficient manner. Next we’ll talk about\\npersisting our data with Firebase and using React Router for, you guessed it,\\nintroducing routing into our app. After that, we’ll put it all together and\\nbuild a “<a href=\\\"http://tylermcginnis.github.io/react-github-notetaker\\\">Github Note\\nTaker</a>” app, an app that\\nallows you to save notes and see a snapshot of a developers Github account\\n(potentially useful for tech interviews where you want to take notes on a\\nparticular candidate). I realize this is a lot, but when I first started\\nlearning React I was frustrated with the lack of tutorials focused on putting\\nall the pieces of React together. This tutorial series hopes to fill that gap.</p>\\n<h4><strong>React.js Fundamentals:</strong></h4>\\n<p>Components are the building blocks of React. If you’re coming from an Angular\\nbackground, components are very similar to Directives. If you’re coming from a\\ndifferent background, they’re essentially widgets or modules. You can think of a\\ncomponent as a collection of HTML, CSS, JS, and some internal data specific to\\nthat component. I like to think of React components as the Kolaches of the web.\\nThey have everything you need, wrapped in a delicious composable bundle. These\\ncomponents are defined either in pure JavaScript or they can be defined in what\\nthe React team calls “JSX”. If you decide to use JSX (which you most likely\\nwill, it’s pretty standard — and it’s what we’ll use for this tutorial), you’ll\\nneed some compile stage to convert your JSX to JavaScript, we’ll get to this\\nlater.</p>\\n<p>What makes React so convenient for building user interfaces is that data is\\neither received from a component’s parent component, or it’s contained in the\\ncomponent itself. Before we jump into code, let’s make sure we have a high level\\nunderstanding of components.</p>\\n<p>Above we have a picture of my Twitter profile. If we were going to re-create\\nthis page in React, we would break different sections up into different\\ncomponents (highlighted). Notice that components can have nested components\\ninside of them. We might name the left component (pink) the “UserInfo”\\ncomponent. Inside the UserInfo component we have another component (orange),\\nthat we could call the “UserImages” component. The way this parent/child\\nrelationship works is our UserInfo component, or the parent component, is where\\nthe ‘state’ of the data for both itself and the UserImage component (child\\ncomponent) lives. If we wanted to use any part of the parent component’s data in\\nthe child component, which we do, we would pass that data to the child component\\nas an attribute. In this example, we pass the UserImage component all of the\\nimages that the user has (which currently live in the UserInfo component). We’ll\\nget more into the details of the code in a bit, but I want you to understand the\\nbigger picture of what’s happening here. This parent/child hierarchy makes\\nmanaging our data relatively simple because we know exactly where our data lives\\nand we shouldn’t manipulate that data anywhere else.</p>\\n<p>The topics below are what I believe to be the fundamental aspects of React. If\\nyou understand all of them and their purposes, you’ll be at a very good spot\\nafter reading this tutorial.</p>\\n<p>JSX — Allows us to write HTML like syntax which gets transformed to lightweight\\nJavaScript objects.</p>\\n<p>Virtual DOM — A JavaScript representation of the actual\\nDOM.</p>\\n<p>React.createClass — The way in which you create a new component.</p>\\n<p>render (method) — What we would like our HTML Template to look like.</p>\\n<p>ReactDOM.render — Renders a React component to a DOM node.</p>\\n<p>state — The internal data store (object) of a component.</p>\\n<p>getInitialState — The way in which you set the initial state of a component.</p>\\n<p>setState — A helper method for altering the state of a component.</p>\\n<p>props — The data which is passed to the child component from the parent component.</p>\\n<p>propTypes — Allows you to control the presence, or types of certain props passed to the child component.</p>\\n<p>getDefaultProps — Allows you to set default props for your component.</p>\\n<p>Component LifeCycle</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>componentWillMount — Fired before the component will mount</li>\\n<li>componentDidMount — Fired after the component mounted</li>\\n<li>componentWillReceiveProps — Fired whenever there is a change to props</li>\\n<li>componentWillUnmount — Fired before the component will unmount</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Events</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>onClick</li>\\n<li>onSubmit</li>\\n<li>onChange</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I know it seems like a lot, but you’ll soon see how each piece is fundamental in\\nbuilding robust applications with React (and I also wasn’t kidding when I said I\\nwanted this to be a comprehensive guide).</p>\\n<p>At this point you should understand, on a very high level, how React works. Now,\\nlet’s jump into some code.</p>\\n<h4>Creating your First Component (JSX, Virtual DOM, render, ReactDOM.render)</h4>\\n<p>First, let’s go ahead and create our very first HelloWorld component so you can\\nvisualize how we use <strong>createClass</strong> to create a component. <strong>createClass</strong>\\ntakes in an object. <strong>This object is what <strong><strong>will</strong></strong> specify the different\\nproperties (render, getInitialState, propTypes) of the component.</strong></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/d5hm5cjL/\\\">Hello World Component Fiddle</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HelloWorld = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        Hello World!\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n\\n\\nReactDOM.render(<span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">HelloWorld</span> /&gt;</span>, document.getElementById('app'));\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>Notice that the only method on the object we’re passing to createClass is the\\n<strong>render</strong> method. Every component is required to have a render method. The\\nreason for that is render is essentially the template for our component. So in\\nthis example the text that will show on the screen where this component is\\nrendered is <strong>Hello World!</strong> A few more things about the code above. We’ve saved\\nthe result of calling our React.createClass constructor into a variable called\\nHelloWorld. We do this because later on we’ll need to tell React to which\\nelement our component should be rendered. This is where ReactDOM.render comes\\ninto play. ReactDOM.render takes in two arguments. The first argument is the\\ncomponent you want to render, the second argument is the DOM node where you want\\nto render the component. <em>(Notice we’re using ReactDOM.render and not\\nReact.render. This was a change made in React .14 to make React more modular. It\\nmakes sense when you think that React can render to more things than just a DOM\\nelement).</em> In the example above we’re telling React to take our <strong>HelloWorld</strong>\\ncomponent and render it to the element with an ID of app. Because of the\\nparent/child child relations of React we talked about earlier, you usually only\\nhave to use ReactDOM.render once in your application because by rendering the\\nmost parent component, all child components will be rendered as well. If you\\nwant your whole app to be React, you would render the component to\\ndocument.body.</p>\\n<p>Now at this point you might feel a little weird throwing “HTML” into your\\nJavaScript. Since you started learning web development, you’ve been told that\\nyou should keep your logic out of the view, AKA keep your JavaScript uncoupled\\nfrom your HTML. This paradigm is strong, but it does have some weaknesses. I\\ndon’t want to make this tutorial longer trying to convince you that this idea is\\na step in the right direction, so if this idea still bothers you you can check\\nout <a href=\\\"http://www.slideshare.net/floydophone/react-preso-v2\\\">this link</a>. As you\\nlearn more about React, this uneasiness should quickly subside. The “HTML” that\\nyou’re writing in the render method isn’t actually HTML but it’s what React is\\ncalling “JSX”. JSX simply allows us to write HTML like syntax which gets\\ntransformed to lightweight JavaScript objects. React is then able to take these\\nJavaScript objects and from them form a “virtual DOM” or a JavaScript\\nrepresentation of the actual DOM. This creates a win/win situation where you get\\nthe accessibility of templates with the power of JavaScript.</p>\\n<p>Looking at the example below, this is what your JSX is transformed to once React\\nruns its transformation process.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/y1qvspm1/\\\">Hello World Component in JS</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HelloWorld = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">displayName</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"HelloMessage\\\"</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> React.createElement(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"div\\\"</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Hello World\\\"</span>);\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now, you can forgo the JSX -&gt; JS transform phase and write your React components\\nlike the code above, but as you can imagine, that would be rather tricky. I’m\\nunaware of anyone who is not using JSX.</p>\\n<p>Up until this point we haven’t really emphasized the importance of this new\\nvirtual DOM paradigm we’re jumping into. The reason the React team went with\\nthis approach is because, since the virtual DOM is a JavaScript representation\\nof the actual DOM, React can keep track of the difference between the current\\nvirtual DOM(computed after some data changes), with the previous virtual DOM\\n(computed befores some data changes). <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DX3vJiqxm4\\\">React then isolates the changes between\\nthe old and new virtual DOM and then only updates the real DOM with the\\nnecessary\\nchanges</a><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DX3vJiqxm4\\\">.</a>\\nIn more layman’s terms, because manipulating the actual DOM is slow, React is\\nable to minimize manipulations to the actual DOM by keeping track of a virtual\\nDOM and only updating the real DOM when necessary and with only the necessary\\nchanges. (<a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DX3vJiqxm4\\\">More info here</a>).\\nTypically UI’s have lots of state which makes managing state difficult. By\\nre-rendering the virtual DOM every time any state change occurs, React makes it\\neasier to think about what state your application is in.</p>\\n<p>The process looks something like this,</p>\\n<p><strong>Signal to notify our app some data has changed→ Re-render virtual DOM -&gt; Diff\\nprevious virtual <strong><strong>DOM</strong></strong> with new virtual DOM -&gt; Only update real DOM with\\nnecessary changes.</strong></p>\\n<p>Because there’s this transformation process from JSX to JS, you need to set up\\nsome sort of transformation phase as you’re developing. In part 2 of this series\\nI’ll introduce using Gulp withReact and how to have your Gulp process include\\nthis JSX to JS transformation and more. For now, we’ll just stick with JSFiddle.\\nIf you’re interested in getting started without Gulp, check out the getting\\nstart guide <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>Let’s take a look back at our “Most Important Parts of React” checklist and see\\nwhere we’re at now.</p>\\n<p><strong>JSX — Allows us to write HTML like syntax which gets transformed to lightweight\\nJavaScript objects.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Virtual DOM — A JavaScript representation of the actual\\nDOM.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>React.createClass — The way in which you create a new component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>render (method) — What we would like our HTML Template to look like.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>ReactDOM.render — Renders a React component to a DOM node.</strong></p>\\n<p>state — The internal data store (object) of a component.</p>\\n<p>getInitialState — The way in which you set the initial state of a component.</p>\\n<p>setState — A helper method for altering the state of a component.</p>\\n<p>props — The data which is passed to the child component from the parent component.</p>\\n<p>propTypes — Allows you to control the presence, or types of certain props passed to the child component.</p>\\n<p>getDefaultProps — Allows you to set default props for your component.</p>\\n<p>Component LifeCycle</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>componentWillMount — Fired before the component will mount</li>\\n<li>componentDidMount — Fired after the component mounted</li>\\n<li>componentWillReceiveProps — Fired whenever there is a change to props</li>\\n<li>componentWillUnmount — Fired before the component will unmount</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Events</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>onClick</li>\\n<li>onSubmit</li>\\n<li>onChange</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>We’re making good pace. Everything in bold is what we’ve already covered and you\\nshould at least be able to explain how those certain components fit into the\\nReact ecosystem.</p>\\n<p><strong>Adding State to your Component (state)</strong></p>\\n<p>Next on the list is “state”. Earlier we talked about how managing user\\ninterfaces is difficult because they typically have lots of different states.\\nThis area is where React really starts to shine. Each component has the ability\\nto manage its own state and pass its state down to child components if needed.\\nGoing back to the Twitter example from earlier, the UserInfo component\\n(highlighted in pink above) is responsible for managing the state (or data) of\\nthe users information. If another component also needed this state/data but that\\nstate wasn’t a direct child of the UserInfo component, then you would create\\nanother component that would be the direct parent of the UserInfo and the other\\ncomponent (or both components which required that state), then you would pass\\nthe state down as props into the child components. In other words, if you have a\\nmulti component hierarchy, a common parent component should manage the state and\\npass it down to its children components via props.</p>\\n<p>Let’s take a look at an example component using it’s own internal state.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/du72b5L2/\\\">Hello {name} With State</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HelloUser = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">username</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@tylermcginnis33'</span>\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        Hello {this.state.username}\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’ve introduced some new syntax with this example. The first one you’ll notice\\nis the getInitialState method. From the definition above, the getInitialState\\nmethod is “The way in which you set the state of a component”. In other terms,\\ngetInitialState returns an object which contains the state or data for our\\n<a href=\\\"http://component.In\\\">component.In</a> the code above we’re telling our component that we want it to keep\\ntrack of a username. This username can now be used inside our component by\\n<strong>{this.state.username}</strong>, which is exactly what we do in our render method.</p>\\n<p>The last thing to talk about with state is that our component needs the ability\\nto modify its own internal state. We do this with a method called <strong>setState</strong>.\\nRemember earlier when we talked about the re-rendering of the virtual dom\\nwhenever the data changes?</p>\\n<p><strong>Signal to notify our app some data has changed→ Re-render virtual DOM -&gt; Diff\\nprevious virtual DOM with new virtual DOM -&gt; Only update real DOM with necessary\\nchanges.</strong></p>\\n<p>That “signal to notify our app some data has changed” is actually just setState.\\nWhenever setState is called, the virtual DOM re-renders, the diff algorithm\\nruns, and the real DOM is updated with the necessary changes.</p>\\n<p>As a sidenote, when we introduce setState in the code below, we’re also going to\\nintroduce a few events that are on our list. Two birds, one stone.</p>\\n<p>So in the next code sample, we’re going to now have an input box that whenever\\nsomeone types into it, it will automatically update our state and change the\\nusername.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/f27qby3L/\\\">Hello {name} with Ability to Change State\\nFiddle</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HelloUser = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">username</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@tylermcginnis33'</span>\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">handleChange</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">e</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.setState({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">username</span>: e.target.value\\n    });\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        Hello {this.state.username} <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">br</span> /&gt;</span>\\n        Change Name: <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">input</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"text\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">value</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{this.state.username}</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onChange</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{this.handleChange}</span> /&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>Note we’ve introduced a few more things. The first thing is the <strong>handleChange</strong>\\nmethod. This method is going to get called every time a user types in the input\\nbox. When handleChange is called, it’s going to call setState to re-define our\\nusername withwhatever was typed into the input box (e.target.value). Remember,\\nwhenever setState is called, React creates a new virtual DOM, does the diff,\\nthen updates the real DOM.</p>\\n<p>Now let’s look at our render method. We’ve added a new line that contains an\\ninput field. The type of the input field is obviously going to be “text”. The\\nvalue is going to be the value of our username which was originally defined in\\nour getInitialState method and will be updated in the handleChange method.\\nNotice there is a new attribute you’ve probably never seen before, <strong>onChange</strong>.\\nonChange is a React thing and it will call whatever method you specify every\\ntime the value in the input box changes, in this case the method we specified\\nwas handleChange.</p>\\n<p>The process for the code above would go something like this.</p>\\n<p>A user types into the input box → handleChange is invoked → the state of our\\ncomponent is set to a new value → React re-renders the virtual DOM → React Diffs\\nthe change → Real DOM is updated.</p>\\n<p>Later on when we cover props, we’ll see some more advanced use cases of handling\\nstate.</p>\\n<p>We’re getting there! If you can’t explain the items in bold below, go re-read\\nthat section. *and one tip on REALLY learning React. Don’t let passively reading\\nthis give you a false sense of security that you actually know what’s going on\\nand can re-create what we’re doing. Head over to JSfiddle and try to recreate\\n(or create your own) components without looking at what I’ve done. It’s the only\\nway you’ll truly start learning how to build with React. This goes for this\\ntutorial and the following to come.</p>\\n<p><strong>JSX — Allows us to write HTML like syntax which gets transformed to lightweight\\nJavaScript objects.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Virtual DOM — A JavaScript representation of the actual\\nDOM.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>React.createClass — The way in which you create a new component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>render (method) — What we would like our HTML Template to look like.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>ReactDOM.render — Renders a React component to a DOM node.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>state — The internal data store (object) of a component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>getInitialState — The way in which you set the initial state of a component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>setState — A helper method for altering the state of a component.</strong></p>\\n<p>props — The data which is passed to the child component from the parent component.</p>\\n<p>propTypes — Allows you to control the presence, or types of certain props passed to the child component.</p>\\n<p>getDefaultProps — Allows you to set default props for your component.</p>\\n<p>Component LifeCycle</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>componentWillMount — Fired before the component will mount</li>\\n<li>componentDidMount — Fired after the component mounted</li>\\n<li>componentWillReceiveProps — Fired whenever there is a change to props</li>\\n<li>componentWillUnmount — Fired before the component will unmount</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Events</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>onClick</li>\\n<li>onSubmit</li>\\n<li>onChange</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Receiving State from Parent Component (props, propTypes, getDefaultProps)</strong></p>\\n<p>We’ve talked about props a few times already since it’s hard to really do much\\nwithout them. By our definition above, props is the data which is passed to the\\nchild component from the parent component. This allows for our React\\narchitecture to stay pretty straight forward. Handle state in the highest most\\nparent component which needs to use the specific data, and if you have a child\\ncomponent that also needs that data, pass that data down as props.</p>\\n<p>Here’s a very basic example of using props.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/jsd0qa3u/\\\">Very Basic Props Example</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HelloUser = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span> Hello, {this.props.name}<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n\\nReactDOM.render(<span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">HelloUser</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Tyler\\\"</span>/&gt;</span>, document.getElementById('app'));\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>Notice on line 9 we have an attribute called name with a value of “Tyler”. Now\\nin our component, we can use <strong>{<a href=\\\"http://this.props.name\\\">this.props.name</a>}</strong> to get “Tyler”.</p>\\n<p>Let’s look at a more advanced example. We’re going to have two components now.\\nOne parent, one child. The parent is going to keep track of the state and pass a\\npart of that state down to the child as props. Let’s first take a look at that\\nparent component.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/xbq2dxut/\\\">Passing a list to a Child\\nComponent</a></p>\\n<p>Parent Component:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> FriendsContainer = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler McGinnis'</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">friends</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Jake Lingwall'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Murphy Randall'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Merrick Christensen'</span>]\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">h3</span>&gt;</span> Name: {this.state.name} <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">h3</span>&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">ShowList</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">names</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{this.state.friends}</span> /&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>There really isn’t much going on in this component that we haven’t seen before.\\nWe have an initial state and we pass part of that initial state to another\\ncomponent. The majority of the new code will come from this child component so\\nlet’s take a closer look at that.</p>\\n<p>Child Component:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> ShowList = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> listItems = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.props.names.map(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">friend</span>)</span>{\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">li</span>&gt;</span> {friend} <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">li</span>&gt;</span></span>;\\n    });\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">h3</span>&gt;</span> Friends <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">h3</span>&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">ul</span>&gt;</span>\\n          {listItems}\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">ul</span>&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Remember that the code that gets returned from our render method is a\\nrepresentation of what the real DOM should look like. If you’re not familiar\\nwith <strong>Array.prototype.map</strong>, this code might look a little wonky. All map does\\nis it creates a new array, calls our callback function on each item in the\\narray, and fills the new array with the result of calling the callback function\\non each item. For example,</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/xgwpzv80/\\\">Array.prototype.map</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> friends = [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Jake Lingwall'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Murphy Randall'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Merrick Christensen'</span>];\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> listItems = friends.map(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">friend</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"&lt;li&gt; \\\"</span> + friend + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"&lt;/li&gt;\\\"</span>;\\n});\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(listItems); <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// [\\\"&lt;li&gt; Jake Lingwall&lt;/li&gt;\\\", \\\"&lt;li&gt; Murphy Randall&lt;/li&gt;\\\", \\\"&lt;li&gt; Merrick Christensen&lt;/li&gt;\\\"];</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The console.log above returns <code>[&quot;&lt;li&gt; Jake Lingwall&lt;/li&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;li&gt; Murphy Randall&lt;/li&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;li&gt; Merrick Christensen&lt;/li&gt;&quot;]</code>.</p>\\n<p>Notice all that happened was we\\nmade a new array and added <code>&lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt;</code> to each item in the original array.</p>\\n<p>What’s great about map is it fits perfectly into React (and it’s built into\\nJavaScript). So in our child component above, we’re mapping over names, wrapping\\neach name in a pair of <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags, and saving that to our listItems variable.\\nThen, our render method returns an unordered list with all of our friends.</p>\\n<p>Let’s look at one more example before we stop talking about props. It’s\\nimportant to understand that wherever the data lives, is the exact place you\\nwant to manipulate that data. This keeps it simple to reason about your data.\\nAll getter/setter method for a certain piece of data will always be in the same\\ncomponent where that data was defined. If you needed to manipulate some piece of\\ndata outside where the data lives, you’d pass the getter/setter method into that\\ncomponent as props. Let’s take a look at an example like that.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/6rhdpt5c/\\\">Passing a List to a Child Component with a Setter\\nMethod</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> FriendsContainer = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler McGinnis'</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">friends</span>: [\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Jake Lingwall'</span>,\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Murphy Randall'</span>,\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Merrick Christensen'</span>\\n      ],\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">addFriend</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">friend</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.setState({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">friends</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.state.friends.concat([friend])\\n    });\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      &lt;div&gt;\\n        &lt;h3&gt;

Notice how I created\\na new AddFriend component that manages the new friend we’re going to add. The\\nreason for this is because the parent component (FriendContainer) doesn’t care\\nabout the new friend you’re adding, it only cares about all of your friends as a\\nwhole (the friends array). However, because we’re sticking with the rule of only\\nmanipulate your data from the component that cares about it, we’ve passed the\\naddFriend method down into our AddFriend component as a propand we call it with\\nthe new friend once the handleAddNew method is called.</p>\\n<p>At this point I recommend you try to recreate this same functionality on your\\nown using the code above as a guidance once you’ve been stuck for 3-4 minutes.</p>\\n<p>Before we move on from props, I want to cover two more React features regarding\\nprops. They are <strong>propTypes</strong> and <strong>getDefaultProps.</strong> I won’t go into too much\\ndetail here because both are pretty straight forward.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html\\\">propTypes</a> allow\\nyou to control the presence, or types of certain props passed to the child\\ncomponent. With propTypes you can specify that certain props are required or\\nthat certain props be a specific type.</p>\\n<p><strong>getDefaultProps</strong> allow you to specify a default (or a backup) value for\\ncertain props just in case those props are never passed into the component.</p>\\n<p>I’ve modified our example from earlier to now, using propTypes, require that\\naddFriend is a function and that it’s passed into the AddFriend component. I’ve\\nalso, using getDefaultProps, specified that if no array of friends is given to\\nthe ShowList component, it will default to an empty array.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/fg685mkg/\\\">Passing a List to a Child Component with a Setter Method with Default Props and\\nType Checking</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> FriendsContainer = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler McGinnis'</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">friends</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Jake Lingwall'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Murphy Randall'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Merrick Christensen'</span>],\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">addFriend</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">friend</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.setState({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">friends</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.state.friends.concat([friend])\\n    });\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      &lt;div&gt;\\n        &lt;h3&gt;

Let’s take a look at\\nour guide and see what we have left.</p>\\n<p><strong>React.createClass — The way in which you create a new component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>render (method) — What we would like our HTML Template to look like.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>ReactDOM.render — Renders a React component to a DOM node.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>state — The internal data store (object) of a component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>getInitialState — The way in which you set the initial state of a component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>setState — A helper method for altering the state of a component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>props — The data which is passed to the child component from the parent component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>propTypes — Allows you to control the presence, or types of certain props passed to the child component.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>getDefaultProps — Allows you to set default props for your component.</strong></p>\\n<p>Component LifeCycle</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>componentWillMount — Fired before the component will mount</li>\\n<li>componentDidMount — Fired after the component mounted</li>\\n<li>componentWillReceiveProps — Fired whenever there is a change to props</li>\\n<li>componentWillUnmount — Fired before the component will unmount</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Events</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>onClick</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>onSubmit</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>onChange</strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>We’re so close!</p>\\n<p><strong>Component LifeCycle</strong></p>\\n<p>Each component you make will have its own lifecycle events that are useful for\\nvarious things. For example, if we wanted to make an ajax request on the initial\\nrender and fetch some data, where would we do that? Or, if we wanted to run some\\nlogic whenever our props changed, how would we do that? The different lifecycle\\nevents are the answers to both of those. Let’s break them down.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://jsfiddle.net/tylermcginnis/L3edLfeL/\\\">Component Life Cycle</a></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> FriendsContainer = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'In getInitialState'</span>);\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler McGinnis'</span>\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Invoked once before first render</span>\\n  componentWillMount: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Calling setState here does not cause a re-render</span>\\n      alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'In Component Will Mount'</span>);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Invoked once after the first render</span>\\n  componentDidMount: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// You now have access to this.getDOMNode()</span>\\n      alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'In Component Did Mount'</span>);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Invoked whenever there is a prop change</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Called BEFORE render</span>\\n  componentWillReceiveProps: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">nextProps</span>)</span>{\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Not called for the initial render</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Previous props can be accessed by this.props</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Calling setState here does not trigger an additional re-render</span>\\n      alert(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'In Component Will Receive Props'</span>);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Called IMMEDIATELY before a component is unmounted</span>\\n  componentWillUnmount: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{},\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        Hello, {this.state.name}\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>componentWillMount</strong>: Invoked once before the <em>initial</em> render. If you were to\\ncall setState here, no re-render would be invoked. An example of this would be\\nif you’re using a service like firebase, you’d set up your reference to your\\nfirebase database here since it’s only invoked once on the initial render.</p>\\n<p><strong>componentDidMount</strong> - Invoked once after the initial render. Because the\\ncomponent has already been invoked when this method is invoked, you have access\\nto the virtual DOM if you need it. You do that by calling\\n<strong>this.getDOMNode()</strong>. <em>Now it might seem like if you wanted to make AJAX\\nrequests you would do that in componentWillMount, but the devs at facebook\\nactually recommend you do that in componentDidMount. So this is the lifecycle\\nevent where you’ll be making your AJAX requests to fetch some data.</em></p>\\n<p><strong>componentWillReceiveProps</strong> - This life cycle is not called on the initial\\nrender, but is instead called whenever there is a change to props. Use this\\nmethod as a way to react to a prop change before render() is called by updating\\nthe state with setState.</p>\\n<p><strong>componentWillUnmount</strong> - This life cycle is invoked immediately before a\\ncomponent is unmounted from the DOM. This is where you can do necessary clean\\nup. For example, going back to our firebase example this is the life cycle event\\nwhere you would clean up your firebase reference you set in componentWillMount.</p>\\n<p>There are a <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html\\\">few\\nmore</a> life cycle\\nmethods, but the ones I’ve covered are the ones that I’ve seen which are the\\nmost useful.</p>\\n<p>Well, if you stuck with me until this point, great job.

This tutorial is going to\\nintroduce Gulp as a way to transform JSX into JS (along with a few other handy\\ntransformations). It’s also going to cover using Browserify with React in order\\nto be able to import/export components for the use in other components.</p>\\n<p><em>I realize that there are many other ways to do the JSX -&gt; JS transformation\\nand specifically a lot of people are using webpack for mostly all of this. Those\\nother ways are great. I’ve found that for beginners though, Gulp and Browserify\\nmake a great pair which abstracts some low level complexities without\\nabstracting everything. I hope to build a future tutorial which uses Webpack\\ninstead of Gulp/Browserify.</em></p>\\n<p>Let’s start with Gulp. If you’ve had experience with another build tool, such as\\nGrunt or Broccoli, this will make a lot of sense. If you have no experience with\\nbuild tools, this next section is more specifically for you.</p>\\n<p>Let’s talk about why we need a tool like Gulp. Think of all the cool tools\\ndevelopers have built on top of things like JavaScript and CSS. Let’s use SASS\\nand Coffeescript as examples. One day this (or perhaps these) developers got\\ntogether and they said something along the lines of “Hey, CSS is cool, but it\\nhas a lot of limitations. Let’s make a language that is a layer on top of CSS.\\nWhat we can do is we can create a language that is more powerful than CSS and\\nhas a lot more features. Then all we have to do is figure out a way for our\\nlanguage to have some sort of process to it which allows developers using our\\nlanguage to convert it (or transpile it) to actual CSS so the browser can\\nunderstand it.” — and that’s exactly what they did. Coffeescript is another\\nexample. That conversation probably went like this “Wow JavaScript is so ugly.\\nThere’s not even a class keyword. We should build a language that isn’t so ugly\\nand then figure out how to transpile it to actual JavaScript because that’s all\\nthe browser can understand.” A conversation similar to this most likely occurred\\nwhen the React team decided to go with this JSX idea. As long as there’s a way\\nto convert the “transpiled language” to a real language the browser can\\nunderstand, there’s no issue. One convenient use case for Gulp is that we can\\ntell Gulp that whenever we change a certain file or whenever we do some certain\\nevent, to go ahead and take our Coffeescript, SASS, JSX (etc), and transpile it\\ninto actual JavaScript or CSS.</p>\\n<p>Though having Gulp transpile your code is great, if you were only doing that,\\nyou probably don’t need the power of Gulp since there are more basic solutions.\\nHowever, we’re going to use Gulp for more than just transpiling our JSX into JS.\\nLet’s think of some more things we do as developers that could be automated with\\na build tool process like Gulp. Perhaps the most obvious processes are the ones\\nwe use right before pushing our code to production. We first minify our code\\n(shorten variable names, remove white space, etc) in order to minimize our file\\nsize. Next thing we usually do is concatenate all of our JavaScript files into\\none file so when the client makes a request to the server for our app, it can\\ngrab that one concatenated JavaScript file without having to worry about making\\na bunch of requests to grab all of the files. Next thing you would need to do is\\nhead over to your HTML page and change out all your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags with just one,\\nwhich was the minified JavaScript file. There are a plethora of things you can\\ndo with Gulp, we’ll stick with the most common ones for this post.</p>\\n<p>Now that you have a better idea of why build tools like Gulp are so handy, let’s\\njump into getting started with Gulp.</p>\\n<p>The first thing you need to do when starting out with Gulp is to use NPM to\\ninstall Gulp globally. If you’re not familiar with NPM, download Node and then\\ndo some googling. Using NPM is outside of the scope of this tutorial but is\\nfairly straight forward.</p>\\n<p>In your terminal run</p>\\n<pre><code>npm install --global gulp\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>that will install gulp globally on your computer.</p>\\n<p>Now, go ahead and make a new project with a folder structure that looks like\\nthis (remember, passively reading this tutorial won’t get you very far).</p>\\n<pre><code>gulpfile.js\\nsrc\\n  index.html\\n  js\\n    App.js\\n    Child.js\\n    Parent.js\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Head over to your <em>index.html</em> page and add the following code.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">html</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">head</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">head</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">body</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">id</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"app\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.12.2/react.min.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"src/Child.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"src/Parent.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"src/App.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">body</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">html</span>&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Notice it’s pretty bare right now.

Now head over to your Parent.js file and add the\\nfollowing code.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Parent = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span> This is the parent. <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Child</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"child\\\"</span>/&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>Now head over to your <em>App.js</em> file and add the following code.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">React.render(<span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Parent</span> /&gt;</span>, document.getElementById('app'));\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>Notice all we’re doing is creating two components, one child, one parent. The\\nparent component is rendered to <em>#app</em> (in <em>App.js</em>), which then renders the\\nchild component passing in “child” as a property on props.</p>\\n<p>Now comes the fun part. Let’s head over to our <em>gulpfile.js</em> file and start\\nbuilding out our build process. Here’s the functionality that we eventually want\\nfrom our final gulp build process.</p>\\n<p>Development</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Transform our JSX into JS and save the output into a dist/src folder.</li>\\n<li>Copy our index.html from our src folder into the dist folder</li>\\n<li>Watch changes to any JS or HTML file then run the previous two processes again.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Production</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Take all the JS files, concat them all together, minify the result, then output\\nthe result to one file named build.js to the build folder inside the dist\\nfolder</li>\\n<li>Replace our <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags in our index.html page with one <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>\\nwhich references our new minified build.js file</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>With these processes above we’ll make it very simple to prepare our code for\\nproduction and also very simple to convert our JSX to JS during development.</p>\\n<h4><strong>Download NPM Packages</strong></h4>\\n<p>The very first thing we need to do is set up our package.json file. For those\\nunfamiliar with what our package.json is for, it’s essentially just a collection\\nof the node packages that are required for our application. In your terminal,\\nhead over to the root of this project then type **npm init **and select from the\\ndifferent options (you can just hit enter until it finishes). The options don’t\\nmatter too much - you can change them later.</p>\\n<p>Once you’re finished with that you’ll have a bare package.json file. Now in your\\nterminal run the following commands.</p>\\n<pre><code>npm install --save-dev gulp;\\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-concat;\\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-uglify;\\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-react;\\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-html-replace;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>If you’ve used npm before, this is pretty straight forward. If you haven’t, we\\npractically just did witchcraft. All we did was tell npm to go and download each\\nof those packages and save them into our <em>node_modules</em> folder (which was\\ncreated for us) and add them to our <em>package.json</em> file as a developer\\ndependency. Now if you check out the <em>node_modules</em> folder, it should be full of\\nthe packages above. What we can do now is in our <em>gulpfile.js</em> file, we can use\\n<strong>require</strong> to essentially import the code from each of the different packages\\nand save that functionality into a variable. Let’s do that right now.</p>\\n<p>In the top of your <em>gulpfile.js</em> file, add the following code.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> gulp = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> concat = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-concat'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> uglify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-uglify'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> react = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-react'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> htmlreplace = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-html-replace'</span>);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Notice we’ve created a variable for each of the packages we downloaded earlier.\\nNow, each of those variables is just whatever was being exported from each\\nindividual package.</p>\\n<p>Before we dive into building our different Gulp tasks, we first need to create a\\npaths object. This paths object is going to be filled with properties that\\nrepresent differents paths. Copy this code under your variable declarations in\\nour <em>gulpfile.js</em> file.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> path = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">HTML</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">ALL</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/js/*.js'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/js/**/*.js'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/index.html'</span>],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">JS</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/js/*.js'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/js/**/*.js'</span>],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">MINIFIED_OUT</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build.min.js'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST_SRC</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist/src'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST_BUILD</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist/build'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist'</span>\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now that are paths are defined, let’s create our first gulp task.</p>\\n<h4><strong>Gulp Tasks for Development</strong></h4>\\n<p>Our first task is going to be called transform and it’s going to be what\\ntransforms our JSX into JS. The code for this task looks like this,</p>\\n<pre><code>gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'transform'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">()</span></span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.JS)\\n    .pipe(react())\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST_SRC));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Perhaps the coolest thing about Gulp is its ability to pipe and chain function\\ninvocations. What this means is that we’re able to take one file, transform it\\nand do something with it, then take that transformation and do something else\\nwith it, then when we’re finished, tell it where to put the newly created file.\\nThat’s exactly what we’re doing above. We create a gulp task called transform\\nand pass it a callback function. In our callback function we grab the <em>path.JS\\narray</em>. Gulp then gets each one of those files, transforms them using the react\\nmethod we initialized earlier then pipes that outcome to <em>dist/src</em>. If you ran\\nthis task, after you’d see that Gulp took all your JS files, converted your JSX\\nto JS, then outputted the results to a new <em>src</em> folder in a new <em>dist</em> folder -\\nall in a manner of milliseconds. Pretty rad.</p>\\n<p>Let’s create our next Gulp task. All this task is going to do is take our\\n<em>index.html</em> file and copy it over to our <em>dist</em> folder so our newly created JS\\nfiles from our transform Gulp task above can be referenced by our <em>index.html</em>\\npage.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'copy'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.HTML)\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’re now going to create our last Gulp task for development. What we want to do\\nis create a task that will always be running so when we change either our\\n<em>index.html</em> or any of the JS files, our two tasks from earlier will run and\\nupdate the code in the <em>dist</em> folder.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'watch'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.watch(path.ALL, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'transform'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'copy'</span>]);\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>What the task above is saying is watch all of our files, whenever any of them\\nchange, run the transform task and the copy task. Pretty straightforward.</p>\\n<p>Now all we want to do for our development tasks is set up a default task. This\\ndefault task will run whenever we type <strong>gulp</strong> in our command line. Here’s the\\ncode for that.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'default'</span>, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'watch'</span>]);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>When we type <strong>gulp</strong>, Gulp will run the watch task, which we know watches our\\nfiles for changes and then runs the <strong>transform</strong> and <strong>copy</strong> tasks.</p>\\n<p>Those are all the tasks we’re going to create for developing. There are\\nobviously a plethora of other tasks you could create for dev, but those are what\\nwe’ll stick with right now. At this point you should be able to run <strong>gulp</strong> and\\nthe JSX in your <em>App.js</em> file will be converted to JS and the output will go to\\n<em>dist/src.</em> Your index.html file should have also been copied over to your dist\\nfolder. Open your <em>index.html</em> page in the browser and you should see your\\ncomponents being rendered.</p>\\n<p><strong>Production Gulp Tasks</strong></p>\\n<p>Now what we want to do is create a few gulp tasks for production so whenever we\\nrun <strong>gulp build</strong> our code will prepare itself to get pushed to production.</p>\\n<p>The first task we’re going to build for production is called <strong>build</strong>. This\\ntask is going to grab all of our JS files, concatenate all of them together,\\nminify them, then output the result to our <em>dist/build</em> folder. The code for\\nthat looks like this.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.JS)\\n    .pipe(react())\\n    .pipe(concat(path.MINIFIED_OUT))\\n    .pipe(uglify(path.MINIFIED_OUT))\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST_BUILD));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The only thing that might look a little strange is the <em>path.OUT</em> argument we’re\\npassing to concat and uglify. All this is doing is telling both of those\\nfunctions what the resulting file path should be, so in this case, when we use\\ngulp.dest it’s going to take the <em>path.MINIFIED_OUT</em> file (<em>build.min.js</em>) and\\noutput it to <em>path.DEST_BUILD</em> (<em>dist/build</em>).</p>\\n<p>Now you might notice this is cool, but at this point it’s a little annoying\\nbecause whenever we run <strong>gulp build</strong>, we then need to go and change our HTML\\nto reference the new <em>build.min.js</em> file rather than <em>src/App.js</em> and whatever\\nother script tags we’re referencing here. What if there were a way to, whenever\\nwe ran our production gulp tasks, to replace all of our <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags with just\\nour new <code>&lt;script src=”build/build.mins.js”&gt;</code> script and then output that new\\nfile to our dist folder? Well, there is. The way we’re going to do that is with\\na <strong>gulp-html-replace</strong>. First, we need to head over to our index.html in our\\nmain src folder and make some additions. Go ahead and modify the original\\nchild/parent/App.js scripts to be wrapped in comments like this.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">&lt;!-- build:js --&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"src/Child.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"src/Parent.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"src/App.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">&lt;!-- endbuild --&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>What’s going to happen is we’re going to tell Gulp, “Hey Gulp, when I tell you\\nto, concat and minify all my JS files and output them to a new <em>dist/build</em>\\nfolder. As you’re doing that go to my copied <em>index.html</em> page in my <em>dist</em>\\nfolder and replace the <strong>build:js</strong> comment and whatever is inside of it with\\nthis new script tag <code>&lt;script src=&quot;build/build.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> but don’t\\nchange my original <em>index.html</em> file in my normal <em>src</em> folder because I still\\nwant to develop with that.”</p>\\n<p>Let’s now build out our replaceHTML task. The code should look like this</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'replaceHTML'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.HTML)\\n    .pipe(htmlreplace({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'js'</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build/'</span> + path.MINIFIED_OUT\\n    }))\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Note that what we give htmlreplace is an object with a key that represents where\\nto replace and whose value is what to replace. That ‘js’ key in htmlreplace\\ncoincides with** build:js** in our <em>index.html</em> page.</p>\\n<p>Very last step is now that both of our production tasks are ready, we need to\\ncreate another task that wraps both of those tasks in one. We do that with the\\nfollowing code</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'production'</span>, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'replaceHTML'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build'</span>]);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now whenever we run <strong>gulp production</strong>, Gulp will run our <strong>replaceHTML</strong> and\\n<strong>build</strong> tasks. Go ahead and give it a try and check that your\\n<em>dist/index.html</em> and <em>dist/build/build.min.js</em> files are correct.</p>\\n<p>For reference, here’s the full <em>gulpfile.js</em> file.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> gulp = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> concat = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-concat'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> uglify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-uglify'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> react = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-react'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> htmlreplace = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-html-replace'</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> path = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">HTML</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">ALL</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/js/*.js'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/js/**/*.js'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/index.html'</span>],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">JS</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/js/*.js'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/js/**/*.js'</span>],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">MINIFIED_OUT</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build.min.js'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST_SRC</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist/src'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST_BUILD</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist/build'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist'</span>\\n};\\n\\ngulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'transform'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.JS)\\n    .pipe(react())\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST_SRC));\\n});\\n\\ngulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'copy'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.HTML)\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST));\\n});\\n\\ngulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'watch'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.watch(path.ALL, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'transform'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'copy'</span>]);\\n});\\n\\ngulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.JS)\\n    .pipe(react())\\n    .pipe(concat(path.MINIFIED_OUT))\\n    .pipe(uglify(path.MINIFIED_OUT))\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST_BUILD));\\n});\\n\\ngulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'replaceHTML'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.HTML)\\n    .pipe(htmlreplace({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'js'</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build/'</span> + path.MINIFIED_OUT\\n    }))\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST));\\n});\\n\\ngulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'default'</span>, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'watch'</span>]);\\n\\ngulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'production'</span>, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'replaceHTML'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build'</span>]);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>At this point we have a full working build process using just Gulp. As you might\\nhave noticed, this method has some weaknesses. First, you have to be very\\ncareful how you load your different components in your HTML. Notice that we’re\\nloading the <em>Child.js</em> file before the <em>Parent.js</em> file. This makes sense\\nbecause <em>Parent.js</em> is dependent upon <em>Child.js</em>. Also note how we’re loading\\n<em>Parent.js</em> before we load <em>App.js</em>, again this is because Parent is required in\\nthe <em>App.js</em> file. It might seem pretty straight forward in this example but as\\nyour app grows, it’s very tricky to keep track of these Parent/Child\\nrelationships and not to mention both Child and Parent are now in the global\\nscope, which from CS 101 we know is not a good thing. Another weakness in this\\nmethod is that if you put a debugger in our JSX, by the time our browser loads\\nthat debugger we’re no longer in JSX land but in JS land and we have no way of\\ntelling which line the error is on in our original JSX code. This isn’t ideal.\\nAlthough we still will always have to debug our transpiled JSX version, it would\\nbe neat if we were able to still get the line numbers of where the error was at\\nin our original JSX file. Good news is when we introduce Browserify into our\\nbuild process, it will take care of both of these weaknesses and more.</p>\\n<p>At a fundamental level, all <a href=\\\"http://browserify.org/\\\">Browserify</a> allows you to\\ndo is require certain packages just like we did earlier with gulp, concat,\\nuglify, etc. This has huge benefits for us because not only do we now have\\naccess to all of NPMs packages, but we’re now able to require only the packages\\n(or React components) we need to for that specific file. This solves our problem\\nof all of our components being on the global scope. Let’s take a quick look at\\nexporting and requiring modules.</p>\\n<p>I remember when I first started leaning about Browserify every definition about\\nit would be in terms of commonjs - which meant literally nothing to me because I\\nknew nothing about commonjs. That is until I fell upon\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2e0161/eli5_amd_commonjs_es6/\\\">this</a>\\narticle on Reddit. The author talks about how Commonjs, AMD, and ES6 Modules are\\nall ways to “break a Javascript project up into multiple self-contained modules\\nand managing the dependencies between them”. That makes sense. I can essentially\\ncreate module that can be passed around and used in other parts of my\\napplication without having to pollute the global scope. The author continues,\\n“CommonJS is the standard implemented by Node. A file can assign any value\\n(including a function or object) to its module.exports property and any other\\nfile can use require(“filename”) to get a copy of that value. It works great in\\nNode but isn’t usable in a web browser; because of a quirk of the way file\\nloading in HTML and Javascript works fetching each of the files would cause the\\nbrowser to hang until it was loaded. There are, however, some tools (browserify)\\nthat will let you write your browser code in CommonJS and automatically convert\\nit to something web appropriate.” Then it clicked. All Browserify allows me to\\ndo is have the greatness of using require in Node, but on the browser. This is\\nfantastic for React because as you’ve probably guessed by now, each React\\ncomponent we create can be its own module that we can then require in other\\ncomponents based off of need. Let’s take a look at some sample commonjs syntax.</p>\\n<p>We’re going to create three files (<strong><em>NOTE: This example (Add, Multiply, Math)\\nis just for demonstrating how Commonjs works, it’s not part of the overall\\ntutorial</em></strong>). The first file will be called <em>Add.js</em> and it will export an\\nobject with an addition helper method on it. The second file will be called\\n<em>Multiply.js</em> and it will export an object with a multiplication helper method\\non it. The third will be called <em>Math.js</em> where we require and then use our Add\\nand Multiply module.</p>\\n<p><strong>Add.js file</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> addObj  = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">add</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">x,y</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> x + y;\\n  }\\n};\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = addObj;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Multply.js file</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> multiplyObj = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">multiply</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">x,y</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> x * y;\\n  }\\n};\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = multiplyObj;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Math.js file</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> addObj = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(‘./Add’);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> multplyObj = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(‘./Multiply’);\\n\\naddObj.add(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">3</span>,<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">4</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 7</span>\\nmultiplyObj.multiply(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>,<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">5</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 10</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Just a few minor things to note about the code above. If you want a certain\\nobject or function to be available in a different file, you use module.exports\\nto export your code.</p>\\n<p>If you want to require whatever was exported from a different file, you use\\nrequire and whatever the name of that file was minus the extension.</p>\\n<p>Now that we have a solid understanding of how Browserify can make our React code\\nmore modular, let’s view the bigger picture of what our build process will look\\nlike when we incorporate browserify. We’re still going to have two main tasks,\\n<strong>watch</strong> and <strong>build</strong>. <strong>watch</strong> for development and <strong>build</strong> for production.\\nOn the surface both of these tasks will look very similar to our tasks before we\\nadded Browserify. Our <strong>watch</strong> task is going to concat our JS files, transform\\nthem from JSX to JS, and output the results into our <em>dist</em> folder. <strong>build</strong>\\nwill also transform our JSX to JS, concatenate, minify, then output the result\\nto out <em>dist</em> folder. The process looks similar, but there are actually some\\nreally cool features introduced by Browserify which we haven’t talked about.\\nWe’ll get those more when we look at the code.</p>\\n<p>Let’s jump in.</p>\\n<p><strong>Browserify + Gulp + React (Development Tasks)</strong></p>\\n<p>Like before, we’re going to start out downloading all of the NPM packages we’ll\\nneed for our new gulpfile. However, before we jump into that let’s hurry and\\nremove an NPM package we were using for the previous example that we won’t be\\nusing for this example. In your terminal run</p>\\n<pre><code>npm uninstall gulp-concat;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This commands remove the Concat libraries from our <em>package.json</em> and our\\n<em>node_modules</em> folder.</p>\\n<p>Now let’s install the new NPM packages we will need. Run the following command\\nin your terminal.</p>\\n<pre><code>npm install --save-dev vinyl-source-stream;\\nnpm install --save-dev browserify;\\nnpm install --save-dev watchify;\\nnpm install --save-dev reactify;\\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-streamify;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’ll get into what each of these packages do when we use them in our tasks.\\nHead over to your <em>gulpfile.js</em> and go ahead and remove everything. It’s easier\\nto start new since we’re introducing a pretty big change with browserify. At the\\ntop of your gulpfile add the following code like we did before.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> gulp = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> uglify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-uglify'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> htmlreplace = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-html-replace'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> source = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'vinyl-source-stream'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> browserify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'browserify'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> watchify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'watchify'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> reactify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'reactify'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> streamify = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'gulp-streamify'</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> path = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">HTML</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'src/index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">MINIFIED_OUT</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build.min.js'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">OUT</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build.js'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST_BUILD</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist/build'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">DEST_SRC</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dist/src'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">ENTRY_POINT</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./src/js/App.js'</span>\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The first task we’re going to create is our copy task. This is exactly the same\\nas before. We’re taking our index.html page and copying it over to our <em>dist</em>\\nfolder.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'copy'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.HTML)\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Our next task is going to be our main task for development. This one is pretty\\nlengthy so I’ll post the code and we’ll walk through it.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'watch'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  gulp.watch(path.HTML, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'copy'</span>]);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> watcher  = watchify(browserify({\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entries</span>: [path.ENTRY_POINT],\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">transform</span>: [reactify],\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">debug</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">true</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">cache</span>: {}, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">packageCache</span>: {}, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">fullPaths</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">true</span>\\n  }));\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> watcher.on(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'update'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    watcher.bundle()\\n      .pipe(source(path.OUT))\\n      .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST_SRC))\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Updated'</span>);\\n  })\\n    .bundle()\\n    .pipe(source(path.OUT))\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST_SRC));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The very first thing we do is tell Gulp to watch our <em>index.html</em> file for any\\nchanges and if something does change, run the copy task.</p>\\n<p>The next thing we do is set up a watcher. Watchify works very closely with\\nBrowserify. A problem that was occurring with these Browserify/React build\\nprocesses was that Browserify would take forever to transpile because it was\\ngoing through every component every single time anything changed and would\\nre-update the new bundled file. Watchify fixes this. Instead of going through\\nevery file, Watchify will cache your files and only update the ones that need to\\nbe updated. This makes builds take a LOT less time.</p>\\n<p>Notice we’re passing a browserify function invocation to our watchify function\\ninvocation. Let’s now talk a bit about that browserify invocation. We’re passing\\nbrowserify an object that is going to essentially set up the configurations for\\nour browserify build. The first property on the object is <strong>entries</strong>. Notice\\nentries is an array with the path of just our main component in it (<em>app.js</em>).\\nYou might remember earlier we had a JS array (<em>['src/js/</em>.js’,\\n'src/js/<em><em>/</em>.js’]</em>) which was every JS file we wanted to be transformed from JSX\\nto JS. Well one perk with browserify is that you just tell it the entry point or\\nthe main component in your app and it will take care of all the child\\ncomponents. Pretty slick. Next we have the <strong>transform</strong> property. Browserify\\nworks with more than just React. Here is where we tell Browserify how to\\ntransform our code. In this case, we’re using reactify which will take care of\\nour JSX to JS transpiling. Next is <strong>debug</strong> which is set to true. This tells\\nBrowserify to use source maps. What source maps do is even though we’re\\nreferencing the transpiled JSX in our index.html page, through source maps when\\nthere is an error in our code, the error will point to the line number in our\\nJSX file rather than our transpiled JS file. This is super convenient for\\ndebugging. That last line with <strong>cache: {}, packageCache: {}, fullPaths: true</strong>\\nis necessary, but we won’t go into it. The watchify website just states that\\nit’s needed in order to use watchify.</p>\\n<p>The next thing we’re going to do is set up our watcher to watch for updates in\\nour parent component or in any of its children components. We tell our watcher\\nto watch for updates then we pass it a callback function to invoke whenever\\nthere is an update. The code in the callback should look fairly familiar.\\n**watcher.bundle() **concatenates all of our different components into one file\\nand does some browserify magic to make the module.exports/requires work. Then\\nthe rest is just piping the result to our <em>dist/src</em> folder. The last thing in\\nour watch task is that we’re continuing to bundle and pipe after we set up the\\non update callback. The reason for this is so that when we first call <strong>gulp\\nwatch</strong> our code will bundle and pipe itself to the dist folder even before a\\nchange is made. Then any changes made to our JS files after that will just\\noverwrite the initial bundled code.</p>\\n<p>The last thing for our development tasks is to set the default gulp task to run\\nthe watch task so we can now just run <strong>gulp</strong> and our watch task will kick off.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'default'</span>, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'watch'</span>]);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4><strong>Browserify + Gulp + React (Production Tasks)</strong></h4>\\n<p>Just like before we started using Browserify, I like to keep my Development and\\nProduction tasks separate. Like before, create a gulp task called <strong>build</strong>.\\nThis task is going to be very similar to our <strong>watch</strong> task except this one is\\nonly going to bundle and pipe our code without actually watching it for updates.\\nIt’s also going to minify the final code then output it to <em>dist/build</em> rather\\nthan <em>dist/src</em>.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  browserify({\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entries</span>: [path.ENTRY_POINT],\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">transform</span>: [reactify]\\n  })\\n    .bundle()\\n    .pipe(source(path.MINIFIED_OUT))\\n    .pipe(streamify(uglify(path.MINIFIED_OUT)))\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST_BUILD));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Like I mentioned, this is mostly the same. We got rid of source mapping and our\\nwatchify stuff and added minification, but that’s it.</p>\\n<p>Also exactly like before we used Browserify, we want to be able to modify our\\nindex.html page when it’s ready for production and switch out our regular\\nscripts with the minified versions. We’ll use the same <strong>replaceHTML</strong> task that\\nwe used before to do this.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'replaceHTML'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  gulp.src(path.HTML)\\n    .pipe(htmlreplace({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'js'</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build/'</span> + path.MINIFIED_OUT\\n    }))\\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.DEST));\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and to wrap both of our production tasks into one gulp process,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'production'</span>, [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'replaceHTML'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'build'</span>]);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and that’s it!

You’ll then most likely look to Google for the source of that\\nanswer and after a bit of researching softly conclude that, yes you should.\\nHowever, I wish that wasn’t always the answer. Flux is great. Flux does a really\\ngood job at what it’s designed to do. I use Flux. A lot of people use Flux. But\\nyou don’t have to use Flux with React. In fact, I would suggest that you don’t\\neven look at Flux until you really understand the pain point that it’s trying to\\nsolve. Too many people jump into React then jump straight to Flux because they\\nthink they have to and are left disappointed with React because Flux is a bit,\\ncomplex. <strong>Don’t let the complexity of Flux ruin the simplicity of React.</strong></p>\\n<p>So, a better question than “Should I learn Flux?” is “Should I use Flux for this\\nparticular project?” and if yes, then learn it. The entire reasoning behind Flux\\nis making data changes in your app easy to reason about. In its most simple\\nform, Flux removes the burden of having a component manage its own state and\\nmoves that data to a central location called a Store where multiple components\\ncan now share that data. Then, everything in that Store’s purpose is to, in one\\nway or another, assist in the modification or preservation of the data. The\\nbenefit of this is that if the data in the Store changes, you know exactly what\\ntriggered the change because the Store is the only place in your app with the\\nability to modify the data.</p>\\n<p>Notice how Flux revolves around the fact that your application has data and that\\ndata needs to be kept up to date in an effective manner. If your app doesn’t\\nhave and or care about dynamic data, Flux might not be the best choice. Flux\\nexcels in respect to data management, but will feel unnecessary if you don’t\\nhave any data to manage.</p>\\n<p>So now that you’re aware of the necessity of your app to have data in order for\\nFlux to be beneficial, let’s talk about the flow of a Flux app. Because, again,\\nthe whole idea of a Flux app is to make your data changes easy to reason about,\\nFlux embraces a one way data flow architecture. So what we’ll do in this\\ntutorial is we’ll walk through every part of the Flux architecture until we have\\na solid grasp of each concept.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*wb78t7XwxmQHIOW6.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Above is a Flux diagram I made that I wish existed when I was learning Flux. It\\nwon’t make a ton of sense now, but as you read through the different parts of\\nthe Flux architecture my hope is that you’ll reference this diagram and it will\\nstart clicking for you. <strong>If you’ve read any of my tutorials before, you know\\nI’m a huge fan of trying to break things down into their most easy to understand\\nform. With Flux, I can honestly say this was a bit difficult. If something\\ndoesn’t make sense, keep reading and then re-read and I’m confident it will\\neventually <em>click</em>.</strong></p>\\n<p>Let’s start off with our components. Remember, one of the main points of Flux is\\nto take the storage of the data out of the component and put it in a more\\ncentral location (Store). Because of that, our components will look exactly the\\nsame except, as you probably guessed, we’ll be calling out to our Actions to add\\ndata and Stores to fetch data.</p>\\n<p>For the sake of having code snippets that demonstrate the principles I talk\\nabout, let’s pretend we’re building a basic Todo List app. I’ll obviously leave\\na lot of parts out, but I’ll include the parts that demonstrate the specific\\nFlux principle.</p>\\n<p>The full source code can be found\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/tylermcginnis/Flux-Todolist\\\">HERE</a>.</p>\\n<h4><strong>Component/View</strong></h4>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> React = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> AddItem = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./AddItem'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> List = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./List'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> todoStore = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../stores/todoStore'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> todoActions = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../actions/todoActions'</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> ListContainer = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">list</span>: todoStore.getList()\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">componentDidMount</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    todoStore.addChangeListener(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>._onChange);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">componentWillUnmount</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    todoStore.removeChangeListener(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>._onChange);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">handleAddItem</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">newItem</span>)</span>{\\n    todoActions.addItem(newItem);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">handleRemoveItem</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">index</span>)</span>{\\n    todoActions.removeItem(index);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">_onChange</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.setState({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">list</span>: todoStore.getList()\\n    })\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n      &lt;div className=\\\"col-sm-6 col-md-offset-3\\\"&gt;\\n        &lt;div className=\\\"col-sm-12\\\"&gt;\\n          &lt;h3 className=\\\"text-center\\\"&gt; Todo List &lt;/h3&gt;\\n          &lt;AddItem add={this.handleAddItem}/&gt;\\n          &lt;List items={this.state.list} remove={this.handleRemoveItem}/&gt;\\n        &lt;/div&gt;\\n      &lt;/div&gt;\\n    )\\n  }\\n});\\n\\nmodule.exports = ListContainer;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Let’s break down this component.</p>\\n<p>First thing you’ll notice is the list property on the object which is being\\nreturned from <em>getIntiailState</em> doesn’t have a value of an empty array but its\\nvalue is instead whatever is being returned from <em>todoStore.getList()</em>. Remember\\nthe reason for this is because we’re taking the data out of the component and\\nputting it into the Store. We’ll cover more about the Store side of things later\\nin this tutorial.</p>\\n<p>Next, you’ll notice the <em>componentDidMount</em> and <em>componentWillUnmount</em> methods.\\nEach of those are calling methods on the todoStore which seem to be adding and\\nremoving an event listener. Head back up to the diagram for a second and reread\\nthe “Views/Component” section. Because we’re relying on the Store to house our\\ndata, we’ll need to make sure that whenever the data in the Store changes, our\\ncomponent knows about that and will update its own state. We accomplish this by\\npassing the store a method (<em>_onChange</em>) which will refetch the data from the\\nstore and update the components state. Now, whenever the Store changes its data,\\nit can invoke the callback function we initially passed it when the component\\nmounted (<em>_onChange</em>) which will make sure the component keeps its data up to\\ndate with what’s in the store. The <em>addChangeListener</em> piece is what’s tying the\\nstore back into the component.</p>\\n<p>The last thing to notice is that every time a user event occurs, whether it’s\\nadding a new item to the todo list (handleAddItem) or removing an item from the\\nlist (handleRemoveItem), we’re invoking a method on our todoActions rather than\\nusing *setState. *Again, this is because our main source of truth for our data\\nis the store, and as the diagram points out, we first need go through our\\nactions in order to eventually update the data in the store.</p>\\n<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>\\n<p>Let’s now take a look at our actions, or the second phase of our Flux diagram.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> AppDispatcher = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../dispatcher/AppDispatcher'</span>);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> appConstants = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../constants/appConstants'</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> todoActions = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">addItem</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">item</span>)</span>{\\n    AppDispatcher.handleAction({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">actionType</span>: appConstants.ADD_ITEM,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">data</span>: item\\n    });\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">removeItem</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">index</span>)</span>{\\n    AppDispatcher.handleAction({\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">actionType</span>: appConstants.REMOVE_ITEM,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">data</span>: index\\n    })\\n  }\\n};\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = todoActions;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Referring back to the diagram, the Dispatcher is what is going to emit a certain\\nevent. Notice the way we keep track of these events is through a constants file.\\nBecause we need to emit a specific type of event, and also listen for that exact\\nsame type of event, a constants object makes perfect sense.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> appConstants = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">ADD_ITEM</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"ADD_ITEM\\\"</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">REMOVE_ITEM</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"REMOVE_ITEM\\\"</span>\\n};\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = appConstants;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Notice literally all this constants object is is a mirrored key value pair.\\nWhose keys/values are whatever the specific event is we’re emitting/listening\\nfor.</p>\\n<p>Back to our actions, since our Dispatcher is the one actually emitting an event,\\nour Actions object can be thought of as essentially just prepping an object\\nbefore it’s dispatched. Notice in our addItem method the actionType is\\nappConstants.addItem and the data is just the specific item we’re adding. These\\nkeys/values will eventually make themselves to our store where we can not only\\nlisten for that specific event (addItem) but also grab the data off of that\\npayload once it gets to the store.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dispatcher</strong></p>\\n<p>Now we’ve arrived at the 3rd part of our diagram, the Dispatcher. You can think\\nof the Dispatcher as the hub of your app. Every time you want to change the data\\nthat lives in a store, you must go through the Dispatcher.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Dispatcher = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'flux'</span>).Dispatcher;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> AppDispatcher = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> Dispatcher();\\n\\nAppDispatcher.handleAction = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">action</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.dispatch({\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">source</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'VIEW_ACTION'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">action</span>: action\\n  });\\n};\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = AppDispatcher;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You probably noticed there’s really not much going on here. That’s because,\\nthere really doesn’t need to be much going on. The whole point of the dispatcher\\nagain is to dispatch certain events. There are plenty of libraries that do this,\\nbut the recommended one is the one we’re using in the code above. It also\\nhappens to be the one facebook uses as well. We require the <em>flux</em> module, then\\ncreate a new instance of the Dispatcher on that module, then set a method on it\\nthat we’ll invoke from any <em>actions</em> in our app. The reason we’re using\\n*VIEW_ACTION *as the source of our dispatch is because you could also be using\\nSERVER_ACTION if that action was coming from the server. The only other thing is\\nto pass along the action which is passed in when handleAction is invoked (and\\ncontains the <em>actionType</em> as well as the <em>data</em>). What’s interesting about our\\nDispatcher is that most people don’t really mention that you’ll use the same\\ndispatcher in all your stores as well in order to register callbacks which will\\nbe invoked when certain Dispatches are dispatched. It’s a little weird at first,\\nbut you can think of the Dispatcher as kind of a bridge. In the main\\nDispatcher.js file is where you set up your <em>handleAction</em> method which will\\ndispatch the actual event, but you also need to make it so your stores actually\\nlisten to those events. So what’s interesting, and kind of confusing at first,\\nis inside your store you’ll require the Dispatcher which you exported from your\\nmain Dispatcher file in order to register some callbacks that will be invoked\\nwhenever the Dispatcher dispatches then hears those certain dispatches. We’ll\\nsee that in the next section on Stores. I realize that got super wordy but stick\\nwith me. The paragraph above will make more sense after reading this next\\nsection.</p>\\n<p><strong>Stores</strong></p>\\n<p>The store, where the magic happens. You can think of a Store as having <strong>four</strong>\\nparts.</p>\\n<p><strong>First</strong>: The actual “model” or data store. What’s great about Flux, is your\\n“model” is just a JavaScript data structure like an object or array. Everything\\nelse in the Store will be built around manipulating or getting this data.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> _store = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">list</span>: []\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Second</strong>: Setter methods. Remember, the whole point of Flux is to make your\\ndata changes easy to reason about. These setter methods will be the only\\ninterface for manipulating the data of our store (which we made in the first\\nstep above).</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> addItem = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">item</span>)</span>{\\n  _store.list.push(item);\\n};\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> removeItem = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">index</span>)</span>{\\n  _store.list.splice(index, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>);\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Third</strong>: The Store itself, which is really just a collection of getter\\nfunctions in order to access the data in the first step along with a few\\nemitter/change listener helpers. Another idea of Flux that might throw you at\\nfirst is Getters vs Setters. Remember, we only want to be able to manipulate the\\ndata from our setter functions (which we made in the second step above).\\nHowever, we want to be able to GET the data whenever we like through our Getter\\nfunctions defined in this step. To accomplish this, we’ll make the setter\\nfunctions “private” to our Store file while we’ll export the actual Store (this\\nstep, or the collection of Getter methods) so that we can require the Store in\\nother files and invoke those getter methods in order to get the data. In other\\nwords, this step is going to be global, while the other steps will be “private”.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> todoStore = objectAssign({}, EventEmitter.prototype, {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">addChangeListener</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">cb</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.on(CHANGE_EVENT, cb);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">removeChangeListener</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">cb</span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.removeListener(CHANGE_EVENT, cb);\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getList</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> _store.list;\\n  },\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>A few things to note about the actual code above. Notice, as mentioned, we have\\nour <em>getList</em> method which just returns us the list. If you remember back to the\\ncomponent we built earlier, you’ll notice in <em>getInitialState</em> we’re invoking*\\ntodoStore.getList() *and setting the result to the list property on our state.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">getInitialState: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">list</span>: todoStore.getList()\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This <em>getList</em> method in the Store above is the interface for getting the data\\nout of the store. We also have the <em>addChangeListener</em> and *removeChangeListener\\n*methods. Again if you remember back to our component we built earlier, when our\\ncomponent mounted, we passed in <em>_.onChange</em> which just used setState to invoke\\n<em>todoStore.getList()</em> in order to refetch the data.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">_onChange: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.setState({\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">list</span>: todoStore.getList()\\n  })\\n},\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">componentDidMount</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  todoStore.addChangeListener(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>._onChange);\\n},\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">componentWillUnmount</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>)</span>{\\n  todoStore.removeChangeListener(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>._onChange);\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Well, the cb parameter we’re passing to addChangeListener and\\n<em>removeChangeListener</em> is that <em>_.onChange</em> function. So now, whenever a\\n<em>CHANGE_EVENT</em> (or “<em>CHANGE</em>”) event is emitted, React will invoke <em>_.onChange</em>\\nwhich will update the state of the component.</p>\\n<p>The last thing to discuss about the <em>todoStore</em> itself above is the use of\\n<em>objectAssign</em> with <em>EventEmitter</em>. All <em>objectAssign</em> allows you to do is\\nextend/combine objects together in order to make “super objects” if you will. By\\nsuper objects, I mean objects whose keys/values are a collection of keys/values\\nfrom different objects. We pass <em>objectAssign</em> a target, or an empty object\\nfirst. This empty object is what the next two parameters are going to add their\\nproperties to. We then pass it EventEmitter.prototype. Now our empty object will\\nget all of the properties that are on the EventEmitter’s prototype object. This\\nwill give our store the ability to do things like .on() and .emit(). The last\\nargument is another object whose properties will be added to the empty object.\\nSo when everything is complete, the object being returned from <em>objectAssign</em> is\\nan object which has all of properties of EventEmitter’s prototype as well as\\n<em>adChangeListener</em>, <em>removeChangeListener</em>, and getList.</p>\\n<p><strong>Fourth</strong>: We need to use our Dispatcher to listen for certain events and when\\nwe hear those events, invoke the setter functions above (in the second step).</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">AppDispatcher.register(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">payload</span>)</span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> action = payload.action;\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">switch</span>(action.actionType){\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">case</span> appConstants.ADD_ITEM:\\n      addItem(action.data);\\n      todoStore.emit(CHANGE_EVENT);\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">break</span>;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">case</span> appConstants.REMOVE_ITEM:\\n      removeItem(action.data);\\n      todoStore.emit(CHANGE_EVENT);\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">break</span>;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">default</span>:\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">true</span>;\\n  }\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Remember, when the handleAction method on our Dispatcher is invoked, it’s going\\nto dispatch an object which will look like this</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">source</span>: ‘VIEW_ACTION’,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">action</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">actionType</span>: ‘SOME_CONSTANT’,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">data</span>: ‘SOME DATA’\\n   }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So on our Switch statement, we’ll be checking the actionType in order to know\\nwhich action was emitted. Based on that actionType, we’ll know exactly what\\nsetter function (which we created in step 2 above) to invoke in order to modify\\nthe data. Once we invoke our setter function, we will then emit a change event,\\nthen, because in our addChangeListener method in our todoStore we set up the\\n.on() event handler, whenever it hears the change event, it will invoke the\\ncallback function which was passed to it which is _onChange from our original\\ncomponent.</p>\\n<p>Here’s the full code for the todoStore.js file.</p>\\n<pre><code

place where our data lives, some setter\\nfunctions, a todoStore object with a getList method a addChangeListener and\\nremoveChangeListener function, and we register our callbacks with the\\nDispatcher.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>When our component mounts, we pass <em>_.onChange</em> to\\n<em>todoStore</em>.<em>addChangeListener</em> which makes it so whenever the Store hears the\\n“CHANGE” event, it will run <em>_.onChange</em> which will refetch the data from the\\nstore using <em>todoStore.getList()</em> and update its own state with the data\\nreturned from <em>getList()</em>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>A user clicks “Submit” wanting to add a new item to their todo list which\\ninvokes a method on the component which we’ll call <em>handleAddItem</em>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><em>handleAddItem</em> runs and invokes the todoActions.addItem method passing it the\\nnew item to add.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The <em>addItem</em> method on our <em>todoActions</em> object invokes\\n<em>AppDispatcher.handleAction</em> passing it an object with the actionType of\\n<em>appConstants.ADD_ITEM</em> and the data of the original todo item.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>When AppDispatcher.handleAction invokes, it emits <em>appConstants.ADD_ITEM</em>,\\nbecause of step 1, the callback we passed to *AppDispatcher.register *in our\\nStore is invoked, the switch statement catches the *appConstants.ADD_ITEM\\n*conditional and then *addItem *is invoked which pushes the new item onto our\\ndata in the Store.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>todoStore emits a “<em>CHANGE</em>” event then because of step 2, <em>todoStore</em> hears\\nthat event which invokes the callback function which was passed to it which was\\noriginally <em>_onChange</em> in our component</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><em>_onChange</em> runs which uses <em>todoStore.getList()</em> in order to update its own\\ninternal state and now we’ve

This idea can be\\nsummed up in the following formula, f(d)=V. A Function takes in some Data and\\nreturns a View.

Now when\\nwe invoke getProfileData we’ll get an object back which represents our user. You\\nshould be very comfortable with the code above.

This makes functions that are pure easy to reason\\nabout and testable.</p>\\n<p>Let’s look at some examples.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">add</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">x,y</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> x + y\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Though simple, <strong>add</strong> is a pure function. There are no side effects. It will\\nalways give us the same result given the same arguments.</p>\\n<p>Let’s now look at two native JavaScript methods. .slice and .splice</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> friends = [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Ryan'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Michael'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Dan'</span>]\\nfriends.slice(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 'Ryan'</span>\\nfriends.slice(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 'Ryan'</span>\\nfriends.slice(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 'Ryan'</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Notice <strong>.slice</strong> is also a pure function. Given the same arguments, it will\\nalways return the same value. It’s predictable.</p>\\n<p>Let’s compare this to .slice’s friend, .splice</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> friends = [<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Ryan'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Michael'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Dan'</span>]\\nfriends.splice(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// [\\\"Ryan\\\"]</span>\\nfriends.splice(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// [\\\"Michael\\\"]</span>\\nfriends.splice(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>) <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// [\\\"Dan\\\"]</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>.splice</strong> is not a pure function since each time we invoke it passing in the\\nsame arguments, we get a different result. It’s also modifying state.</p>\\n<p>Why is this important for React? Well the main reason is React’s <strong>render</strong>\\nmethod needs to be a pure function and because it’s a pure function, all of the\\nbenefits of pure functions now apply to your UI as well. Another reason is that\\nit’s a good idea to get used to making your functions pure and pushing “side\\neffects” to the boundaries of your program. I’ll say this throughout the course,\\nReact will make you a better developer if you learn React the right way.\\nLearning to write pure functions is the first step on that journey.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2016-02-20-building-ui-with-pure-fns-and-fn-comp-in-react/index.md\n// module id = 449\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"React Tutorial 1.5: Utilizing Webpack and Babel to build a React.js App\",\"date\":\"2016-02-20T05:12:03.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/react-js-tutorial-1-5-utilizing-webpack-and-babel-to-build-a-react-js-app-5f804d729d3b/\",\"body\":\"<p>Let me preface this section by saying that Webpack is hard. Partially because\\nit’s an extremely powerful tool and partially because the documentation is\\nterrible. If you have experience with other tools like Gulp or Grunt it’s a bit\\neasier, but if you don’t, just hold on and it will get easier. We’re going to\\nhyperfocus on the real meat of Webpack for this course and jump into more\\nadvanced features in other courses.</p>\\n<p>The first questions you should ask yourself whenever you’re using a new tool are\\n“Why does this thing exist?” and “What problem is this thing solving?”. If you\\ncan’t eventually answer those two questions, you probably don’t need it. So\\nlet’s answer those questions in terms of Webpack.</p>\\n<p>Why does webpack exist? Webpack, at its core, is a code bundler. It takes your\\ncode, transforms and bundles it, then return a brand new version of your code.</p>\\n<p>What problem is this thing solving? Think about how many times we have to take\\nour code and change it so it’s compliant with what the browser is used to\\n(vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). If you’ve ever used a CSS Preprocessor like\\nSASS or LESS you know you need to transform your SASS/LESS code into normal CSS.\\nIf you’ve ever used CoffeeScript or any compile to JavaScript language you know\\nthere’s also a conversion step there. So where Webpack really shines is you’re\\nable to tell it every transformation your code needs to make, and it will do\\nthem and output a bundle file for you full of those changes (and some other\\nhelpful things as well like minification if you desire).</p>\\n<p>In this specific course we’re going to keep our Webpack configurations pretty\\nlight, but in future courses we’ll jump into some more advanced topics.</p>\\n<p>If you think about the process we talked about above, that idea of taking your\\ncode and transforming it in someway then spitting it out — there are really\\nthree main steps and three main things Webpack need to know.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Webpack needs to know the starting point of your application, or your root\\nJavaScript file.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Webpack needs to know which transformations to make on your code.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Webpack needs to know to which location it should save the new transformed\\ncode.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The code for this might look a little scary at first, but know that all we’re\\ndoing is coding out those three steps above so Webpack can understand them.</p>\\n<p>The first thing we need to do is create a file which is going to contain our\\nWebpack configurations. Conveniently, this file should be named\\n<strong>webpack.config.js</strong> and be located in the root directory of our project.</p>\\n<p>Now that we have our file made we need to make sure that this file exports an\\nobject which is going to represent our configurations for Webpack. If you’re not\\nfamiliar with JavaScript modules, I highly recommend <a href=\\\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/javascript-modules-a-beginner-s-guide-783f7d7a5fcc#.g9p44q9ly\\\">this blog\\nseries</a>\\nby <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/iam_preethi\\\">Preethi</a>.</p>\\n<p>Now let’s go ahead and walk down our list of those three items and convert them\\ninto code. First up, telling webpack where the entry point of our application is\\nlocated. This one is pretty straight forward and looks like this,</p>\\n<p>All we do is give our object a property of <strong>entry</strong> and a value which is an\\narray with a string which points to our root JavaScript file in our app. You\\nmight be asking why it’s an array instead of just a string. Webpack allows you\\nto have one or many entry points in your application. If you just have one, you\\ncan just use a string. If you have more, you can use an array. I always default\\nto an array so I can easily add more later if needed.</p>\\n<p>Now that we’ve told Webpack where to start, we need to tell it which\\ntransformations to actually make. This is where <strong>loaders</strong> will come in handy.</p>\\n<p>Let’s say that for some reason we’re still writing CoffeeScript in 2016 (ZING!).\\nWe would need a way to transform our CoffeeScript into regular JS. Sounds like\\nthe perfect place for a CoffeeScript loader. First step, we need to install the\\nloader we want. We’ll use npm to do this. In your terminal you would run <strong>npm\\ninstall — save-dev coffee-loader</strong> which would then save coffee-loader as a dev\\ndependency in your package.json file. Next, we need to configure our\\nwebpack.config.js file to be aware of this specific transform. To do that we’ll\\nfirst need to add a **module **property to the object we’re exporting in\\nwebpack.config.js and then that module property will have a property of\\n<strong>loaders</strong> which is an array.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// In webpack.config.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entry</span>: [\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./app/index.js'</span>\\n  ],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">module</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: []\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Inside of that loaders array is where we’re (obviously) going to put all of our\\ndifferent loaders or transformations we want to take place.</p>\\n<p>Each loader needs to be composed of three things. The first is which file type\\nto run the specific transformation on. For example, we don’t want to run CSS\\ntransformations on a JavaScript file and vice versa. The next item is which\\ndirectories should be included or excluded from being transformed. An example\\nhere is we don’t want to run our transformations on anything in our node_modules\\nfolder, so we’d have the node_modules path as an excluded value. The last thing\\nis the specific loader we want to run. Let’s take a look at what this looks\\nlike.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// In webpack.config.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entry</span>: [\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./app/index.js'</span>\\n  ],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">module</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [\\n      {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">test</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\.coffee$/</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">include</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/app'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loader</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"coffee-loader\\\"</span>}\\n    ]\\n  },\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The first thing you’ll probably notice is the <strong>test:/.js$/</strong> section. It looks\\nscary if you’re not used to regular expressions but all it’s doing is it tells\\nWebpack to run the coffee-loader on all extensions that end in .coffee.</p>\\n<p>Next, <strong>include</strong> tells Webpack which directories to include in our\\ntransformations. Instead of excluding node_modules, I chose to think positively\\nand include the directory we’d like transformed. Last step is an obvious one.\\n<strong>loader</strong> tells Webpack which transformation to run on all paths that match the\\n<strong>test</strong> RegEx and are in the <strong>include</strong> directory.</p>\\n<p>As you can see, the steps from including more loaders is pretty basic. NPM\\ninstall the specific loader then add a new object to the loaders array.</p>\\n<p>Now that we’ve done steps 1 and 2, we just have one more step. This last step is\\nspecifying where Webpack should output the new transformed code.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// In webpack.config.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entry</span>: [\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./app/index.js'</span>\\n  ],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">module</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [\\n      {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">test</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\.coffee$/</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">include</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/app'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loader</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"coffee-loader\\\"</span>}\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">output</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">filename</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"index_bundle.js\\\"</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">path</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/dist'</span>\\n  },\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Again the code here is pretty self explanatory. <strong>filename</strong> is the name of the\\nfile that Webpack is going to create which contains our new transformed code.\\n<strong>path</strong> is the specific directory where the new filename (<strong>index_bundle.js</strong>)\\nis going to be placed. If you’ve never seen <strong>__dirname</strong> before that’s just\\nreferencing the name of the directory that the currently executing script\\nresides in.</p>\\n<p>So now when Webpack runs, our code will be transformed and then can be\\nreferenced at <strong>ourApp/dist/index_bundle.js</strong>. Well that’s great, but now we\\nneed to come up with a plan to get our HTML to reference this specific file.\\nThere are a few options, but most are crappy. If we look at how normal apps are\\nusually structured it’s usually something like this.</p>\\n<pre><code>/app\\n  - components\\n  - containers\\n  - config\\n  - utils\\n  index.js\\n  index.html\\n/dist\\n  index.html\\n  index_bundle.js\\npackage.json\\nwebpack.config.js\\n.gitignore\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So as you can see, our code we’re developing with is found in the <strong>app</strong> folder\\nand our transformed code is in the <strong>dist</strong> folder. Now you can visually see the\\nissue. We want to change the <strong>index.html</strong> located in the <strong>app</strong> folder but\\nthe <strong>index.html</strong> file that the browser is actually going to be using is\\nlocated in the <strong>dist</strong> folder (because that’s where we’ve also told webpack to\\nspit out the transformed JS file).</p>\\n<p>The first option to solve this is to just manage two index.html files and\\nwhenever you change the one located in /app, copy/paste that to the one located\\nin /dist. Though this will work, I won’t be able to look my Wife in the eyes\\nagain if we do this.</p>\\n<p>Second option, we could figure out a way so that whenever webpack runs, our\\n<strong>/app/index.html</strong> gets copied over to <strong>/dist/index.html</strong>. This sounds a lot\\nbetter and the final solution will look close to this.</p>\\n<p>As you can probably guess, there’s already a Webpack tool that allows us to do\\nsomething similar. Instead of actually copying our index.html file, it’s just\\ngoing to use that file as a template and create a brand new index.html file.\\nThis plugin is the html-webpack-plugin. As always, you’ll need to run <strong>npm\\ninstall — save-dev html-webpack-plugin</strong> before you can use it. Now we just need\\nto tell webpack what we want to do with it.</p>\\n<p>First thing, we’ll need to create a new instance of HTMLWebpackPlugin and we’ll\\nneed to specify three things. First, we can give it a <strong>template</strong> of what we\\nwant the newly created file to look like. Second, we give it a <strong>filename</strong> or,\\nwell, what the new file it creates is going to be called. Third,\\nWebpackPluginConfig is going to be smart enough to detect the filename of the\\noutput of the transformed code (in this case we’re calling index_bundle.js) and\\nit then going to inject a script into the <head> or <body> of the newly created\\nindex.html file. So the third option is <strong>inject</strong> and is where you would like\\nto inject that script — the ‘head’ or the ‘body’.</p>\\n<p>Let’s see what all the code looks like.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// In webpack.config.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HtmlWebpackPlugin = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'html-webpack-plugin'</span>)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HTMLWebpackPluginConfig = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> HtmlWebpackPlugin({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">template</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/app/index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">filename</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">inject</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'body'</span>\\n});\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entry</span>: [\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./app/index.js'</span>\\n  ],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">module</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [\\n      {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">test</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\.coffee$/</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">include</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/app'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loader</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"coffee-loader\\\"</span>}\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">output</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">filename</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"index_bundle.js\\\"</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">path</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/dist'</span>\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">plugins</span>: [HTMLWebpackPluginConfig]\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You’ll notice we’ve added a few more steps. At the top of the file we create a\\nnew instance of <strong>HtmlWebpackPlugin</strong> and we give it three options. <strong>template</strong>\\npoints to our regular index.html file located in our app directory. <strong>filename</strong>\\njust says we want to keep the name index.html. <strong>inject</strong> says to inject a\\nscript which references the name of the output file (index_bundle.js) of our\\nloaders and put it in the body of this newly created HTML file. Lastly we add\\nthe <strong>HTMLWebpackPluginConfig</strong> variable we created as an item in the array of\\n<strong>plugins</strong> in our webpack config.</p>\\n<p>Now when we run **webpack **from our command line, inside of our <strong>dist</strong> folder\\nwe’ll have two files. <strong>index_bundle.js</strong> and <strong>index.html</strong>.\\n<strong>index_bundle.js</strong> is the result of taking our <strong>entry</strong> code and running it\\nthrough our loaders. While <strong>index.html</strong> was created on the fly with\\n<strong>HTMLWebpackPluginConfig</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Let’s take a look at what our index.html file inside of our <strong>app</strong> folder looks\\nlike then what our newly created index.html file inside of <strong>dist</strong> looks like.</p>\\n<p><strong>app/index.html</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">html</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">lang</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"en\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">head</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">meta</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">charset</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"UTF-8\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">title</span>&gt;</span>My App<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">title</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">link</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">rel</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"stylesheet\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">href</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"styles.css\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">head</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">body</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">id</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"app\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">html</span>&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>dist/index.html</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">html</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">lang</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"en\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">head</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">meta</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">charset</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"UTF-8\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">title</span>&gt;</span>My App<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">title</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">link</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">rel</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"stylesheet\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">href</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"styles.css\\\"</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">head</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">body</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">id</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"app\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">src</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"index_bundle.js\\\"</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"undefined\\\"></span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">html</span>&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You’ll notice that the only difference between the two files is that the one in\\n<strong>dist</strong> (which was created with HTMLWebpackPlugin) now has a script tag\\npointing to** index_bundle.js** . Again, the only real magic going on here is\\nthat HTMLWebpackConfig is smart enough to detect the <strong>output</strong> <strong>filename</strong> of\\nyour newly created file from Webpack and it will automatically add that as a\\nscript in your newly create index.html file. So in our example we used**\\nindex_bundle.js** as the <strong>output filename</strong> so as you can see in the created\\nindex.html file above, we have now have <strong><script\\nsrc=”index_bundle.js”></script></strong> inside the body. If we were to change the\\noutput of our webpack config to be <strong>OUR-AWESOME-JS-FILE.js</strong>, then inside the\\nbody of our newly create index.html file we would have <strong><script\\nsrc=”OUR-AWESOME-JS-FILE.js”></script></strong></p>\\n<p>Now the only other crucial piece of information is how to actually tell webpack\\nto run.</p>\\n<p>If you’ve installed webpack globally (by running <strong>npm install -g webpack</strong>)\\nthen you have access to the webpack CLI. (If you haven’t, the same rules below\\napply but you’ll just have to just npm scripts to run them).</p>\\n<p>In the root directory of your app (or wherever webpack.config.js is located),\\nyou can run <strong>webpack</strong> from your terminal and that will do a one time run\\nthrough of your webpack settings. However, this can be kind of a pain to keep\\nhaving to run the command over and over whenever you change anything. To fix\\nthis, run <strong>webpack -w</strong> and that will watch your files and re-execute\\n<strong>webpack</strong> whenever any of the files Webpack is concerned about changes.\\nLastly, if you’re wanting to ship to production, you can run <strong>webpack -p</strong> and\\nthat will run through the normal transformations as well as minify your code.</p>\\n<p>So now you’re probably thinking, “Hey Tyler. That’s cool and all, but I came\\nhere for React and I still haven’t seen any of it.” First off, calm down.\\nSecond, that’s fair. The good news is you already have all the Webpack knowledge\\nyou need to get going with React. Now we just need to look at a tool called\\nbabel and add it as a loader.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/\\\">Babel.js</a> is a wonderful tool for compiling your\\nJavaScript. With Webpack you tell it which transformations to make on your code,\\nwhile Babel is the specific transformation itself. In terms of React, Babel is\\ngoing to allow us to transform our JSX (which you’ll see soon) into actual\\nJavaScript. What’s nice about Babel though is it can be used for much more than\\njust JSX -&gt; JS transformations. You can also opt into “future” versions of\\nJavaScript (ES2015, 2016, etc) and use Babel to transform your future JavaScript\\nto modern day JavaScript so the browser can understand it. Let’s jump into what\\nthis looks like.</p>\\n<p>As always we’ll need to NPM install some things. Babel is very modular, so we’ll\\nneed to install a few things initially. If you’re following along you can run\\n<strong>npm install — save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react</strong>.\\nbabel-core is babel itself, babel-loader is the webpack loader we’ll use, and\\nbabel-preset-react is to get the JSX -&gt; JS transformation going.</p>\\n<p>You might have the temptation to add a new loader to webpack for each type of\\nBabel transformation we want to make but that’s not the case. Instead, you just\\ngive Webpack the single** babel-loader **we installed then that loader will look\\nto a <strong>.babelrc</strong> file that we’ll make for each of the babel transformations you\\nwant to make.</p>\\n<p>First, in the same directory where the <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> file is (usually\\nthe root directory), we’ll need to make a <strong>.babelrc</strong> file which looks like\\nthis</p>\\n<pre><code>{\\n  &quot;presets&quot;: [\\n    &quot;react&quot;\\n  ]\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Again all this file does is it instructs our babel-loader which babel\\ntransformations to actually make. For now, all we care about is the react\\ntransform. This works because we npm installed babel-preset-react earlier.</p>\\n<p>Now all we need to do is add the babel-loader as a loader to our\\nwebpack.config.js file.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// In webpack.config.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HtmlWebpackPlugin = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'html-webpack-plugin'</span>)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> HTMLWebpackPluginConfig = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> HtmlWebpackPlugin({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">template</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/app/index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">filename</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'index.html'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">inject</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'body'</span>\\n});\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>.exports = {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">entry</span>: [\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./app/index.js'</span>\\n  ],\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">output</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">path</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/dist'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">filename</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"index_bundle.js\\\"</span>\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">module</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loaders</span>: [\\n      {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">test</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-regexp\\\">/\\\\.js$/</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">include</span>: __dirname + <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/app'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">loader</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"babel-loader\\\"</span>}\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">plugins</span>: [HTMLWebpackPluginConfig]\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You’ll notice everything here is the same but instead of our ugly coffee-script\\nloader, we’re not using our babel-loader.</p>\\n<p>That’s it!

That means it needs to be stateless, it needs to not make any Ajax\\nrequests, etc. It should just receive state and props and then render a UI.</p>\\n<p>Though we can’t do those things in the render method, they’re still pretty\\ncritical for building a React app. So now the question, where should those\\nthings go? To answer this question, we’ll dive into React Life Cycle methods.\\nLifecycle methods are special methods each component can have that allow us to\\nhook into the views when specific conditions happen (i.e. when the component\\nfirst renders or when the component gets updated with new data, etc).</p>\\n<p>There are many different life cycle methods, but in this post we’re going to\\nexplore the ones that are used most often (which will cover ~90% of use cases).</p>\\n<p>You can really break React’s Life Cycle Methods down into two categories.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>When a component get mounted to the DOM and unmounted.</li>\\n<li>When a component receives new data.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>Mounting / Unmounting</strong></p>\\n<p>In this section we’re going to focus on those life cycle methods which are\\ncalled when the component is initialized and added to the DOM (mounting), and\\nwhen the component is removed from the DOM (unmounting). By definition then,\\nthese methods will be invoked only once during the life of the component.</p>\\n<p>For a moment I want you to step back and think about some items that may be\\nimportant to do when a component mounts or unmounts.</p>\\n<p>Here are some things that we may need to do:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Establish some default props in our component</li>\\n<li>Set some initial state in our component</li>\\n<li>Make an Ajax request to fetch some data needed for this component</li>\\n<li>Set up any listeners (ie Websockets or Firebase listeners)</li>\\n<li>Remove any listeners you initially set up (when unmounted)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>What I want you to do is really think about the problem we’re trying to solve.\\nIf you’re good and you understand it, continue on.

Looking at code won’t help you too much if you don’t understand the\\nunderlying issues we’re trying to solve.</em></p>\\n<p>Let’s walk through each one of our needs from above and correlate that with a\\nLife Cycle Method.</p>\\n<p><strong>Establish some default props in our component:</strong></p>\\n<p>We’re going to cover this more in depth in a later section but say we want to\\nmake it so that even if the consumer of our component doesn’t pass in a certain\\nprop, that prop still has a default value. We can do that with the\\n<strong>getDefaultProps</strong> method.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Loading = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getDefaultProps</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">text</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Loading'</span>\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    ...\\n  }\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So if we had a Loading component that took in a loading <strong>text</strong>, we could make\\nsure that if a <strong>text</strong> attribute isn’t provided to the component,\\n<strong>this.props.text</strong> will by default be ‘Loading’.</p>\\n<p><strong>Set some initial state in our component</strong></p>\\n<p>You saw a glimpse of this in the previous video. Sometimes you’ll want your\\ncomponent to manage some piece of state. In order to do that you’ll first need\\nto set some initial state of your component when your component is first added\\nto the DOM. To do this you can use <strong>getInitialState</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> Login = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">getInitialState</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">email</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">password</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">''</span>\\n    }\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    ...\\n  }\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Above we’ve used <strong>getInitialState</strong> to set an <strong>email</strong> and <strong>password</strong>\\nproperty on our state object in our <strong>Login</strong> component. To update the state,\\nyou can call** this.setState** passing in a new object which overwrites one or\\nboth of the email and password properties.</p>\\n<p><strong>Make an Ajax request to fetch some data needed for this component</strong></p>\\n<p>This is a very common use case. The component needs some data that it’s going to\\nget from an Ajax request. You can do this utilizing <strong>componentDidMount</strong>. This\\nwill get called right after the component is mounted to the DOM.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> FriendsList = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">componentDidMount</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> Axios.get(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.props.url)\\n      .then(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.props.callback)\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    ...\\n  }\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Here we’re using Axios to fetch some data then call a callback we received from\\nprops once that data is resolved.</p>\\n<p><strong>Set up any listeners (ie Websockets or Firebase listeners)</strong></p>\\n<p>As you might have guessed, this is a perfect opportunity to use\\n<strong>componenDidMount</strong> as well.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> FriendsList = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">componentDidMount</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    ref.on(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'value'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">snapshot</span>) </span>{\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.setState({\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">friends</span>: snapshot.val()\\n      })\\n    })\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    ...\\n  }\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now that we’ve set up that listener, we want to be sure to remove it when the\\ncomponent is removed from the DOM so we don’t have memory leaks.</p>\\n<p><strong>Remove any listeners you initially set up (when unmounted)</strong></p>\\n<p>That’s where <strong>componentWillUnmount</strong> comes into play.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> FriendsList = React.createClass({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">componentWillUnmount</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    ref.off()\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">render</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n    ...\\n  }\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now let’s look at Life Cycle Events that are going to be called whenever the\\ncomponent receives new data from its parent component.</p>\\n<p>The first is <strong>componentWillReceiveProps</strong>. There will be times that you’ll want\\nto execute some code whenever your component receives new props. That’s exactly\\nwhat componentWillReceiveProps does. We’ll cover this more in depth in future\\ncourses</p>\\n<p>The second is a more advanced case and is <strong>shouldComponentUpdate</strong>. React is\\nvery intelligent about not re-rendering unless something changed. You can make\\nit even more intelligent by implementing <strong>shouldComponentUpdate</strong>.\\nshouldComponentUpdate returns a boolean, if that boolean is true, that component\\nwill re-render. If it’s false, that component (and naturally all child\\ncomponents), won’t re-render. This can be a huge performance gain if you know\\nexactly when you want to re-render (based on either the state or the props of\\nyour components). We’ll cover this more in depth in a future course.</p>\\n<p>Though we didn’t cover every life cycle event in this post, this chart below\\nshould be of some help.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*VoYsN6eq7I_wjVV5.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2016-02-25-intro-to-lifecyce-events-in-react/index.md\n// module id = 451\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Introducing React.js Program\",\"date\":\"2016-03-01T14:12:03.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/introducing-react-js-program-2c90f269a663/\",\"body\":\"<p>It’s 3:30AM. I don’t think I’ve been to bed before this time in over a month.\\nI’m ok with this, however. I’ve always loved teaching and for the most part I\\nthink people enjoy my teaching as well. I spent two years teaching the people of\\nLos Angeles about Jesus, so teaching literally anything else seems pretty\\nsimple, since, well, many people don’t want to listen to a 19 year old talk\\nabout Jesus.</p>\\n<p>I started teaching technical topics at <a href=\\\"http://devmounta.in/\\\">DevMountain</a> and\\nshortly after took over all operations of their whole Web program. It was a\\nblast and it taught me how to teach technical topics quickly and efficiently.\\nTeaching is essentially the same thing as programming except instead of\\nprogramming computers you’re programming brains. Teaching at DevMountain was\\ndone entirely in person and it was here I also learned how to build curriculum\\nto supplement teaching. Last March I wanted to see if the “bootcamp” approach\\ncould be taken outside of the context of beginners and carefully turned towards\\nmid-sr level developers. I launched <a href=\\\"http://www.reactweek.com/\\\">React Week</a> with\\nthis goal in mind and from what I could see, everyone enjoyed it.</p>\\n<p>Later I started teaching on\\n<a href=\\\"https://egghead.io/instructors/tyler-mcginnis\\\">Egghead.io</a>. Teaching short (3–5\\nminute) videos is much different than full hour long classes in person. It’s\\nlike snowboarding and skateboarding. It helps to know one, but it’s still\\nentirely different. Luckily the great people at Egghead have the system down and\\nthey’ve graciously shared the tips with their instructors.</p>\\n<p>Somewhere in all of this I started blogging more and learned to love writing\\nabout technical topics.</p>\\n<p>At this point I had pretty solid experience in basically every format of\\nteaching — in person, online via recorded videos, and through text via my blog.\\nInterestingly enough I wouldn’t say that one medium is more effective over the\\nother — they’re all just, different. Combine this sort of thinking/experience\\nwith the outcry of JavaScript fatigue in the community and <a href=\\\"http://www.reactjsprogram.com/\\\">React.js\\nProgram</a> was born. The goal is to take my unique\\nviews of teaching through different mediums and combine it into one program.</p>\\n<p>The whole premise of React.js Program is that the student is going to have three\\ndifferent learning approaches thrown at them. First via text. Second via a\\nvideo. Third via curriculum.</p>\\n<p>Not only are there different learning mediums, but each medium has different\\nprerequisite knowledge applied to it. When teaching you have to walk the thin\\nline of practical and easy to consume. Building projects bring practicality but\\nthey also require a prerequisite knowledge of the other parts of the codebase\\n(and even if they don’t, students are convinced they do). Having hyper focused\\nexamples are easy to consume but then students struggle with “putting the pieces\\ntogether”. My solution to this was having the text sections be hyper focused and\\nhaving the videos be project based. Naturally this means that each text section\\ncan stand by itself (and for the most part can even be read out of order) while\\nthe video examples have a specific order since we’re building a project\\ntogether. Combine this with actual projects students are required to work\\nthrough on their own to apply what’s been taught via text and videos and you can\\nsee why I haven’t slept in a while 🙃.</p>\\n<p>I think there are those times in life when you’re about to release something\\ninto the world that you’ve been working tirelessly on and are nervous about the\\noutcome.

Naturally, we tend to accomplish a task when the incentive outweighs\\nthe resources needed to accomplish that task. With OSS, the incentive almost\\nalways approaches zero as the project matures.</p>\\n<p>At the beginning of March I released <a href=\\\"http://reactjsprogram.com/\\\">React.js Program — “a linear approach to\\nlearning the React.js ecosystem”</a>.

It’s been an amazing ride thus far and one\\nthat I hope to continue to grow and learn from. However, one thing has been\\nclear to me since the day I launched — React.js Program would not be possible if\\nit weren’t for the individuals who sacrificed their time and energy for the sake\\nof open source.</p>\\n<p>I’m of the opinion that if you’re profiting off of an open source ecosystem, you\\nshould give back in any way you can.

You might have even searched for what those terms\\nactually mean.</p>\\n<p>Sadly, you probably encountered a definition similar to this, “You know,\\nimperative programmingis like <strong>how</strong> you do something, and declarative\\nprogramming is more like <strong>what</strong> you do, or something.”</p>\\n<p>That definition makes perfect sense once you actually know the difference\\nbetween imperative and declarative — but you don’t, which is why you asked the\\nquestion in the first place. It’s like trying to answer “What came first, the\\nchicken or the egg?” except everyone seems to think the chicken did, but you\\ndon’t even like eggs, and you’re confused.</p>\\n<p>Combine this frustration with the bastardization of the actual\\nword “declarative” to basically just mean\\n“<a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/jergason/status/699379381127368704\\\">good</a>” and all of a\\nsudden your imposter syndrome is tap dancing on your confidence, and you realize\\nyou don’t even like programming that much.</p>\\n<p>Don’t worry though, friend. I don’t know what a monad is, so hopefully this post\\nwill help you realize that declarative is more than just being “easy to reason\\nabout” and “good.”</p>\\n<p>The hard part about this topic is, as\\n<a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/iammerrick/status/699373002249498624\\\">Merrick</a> has\\nobserved, “It’s one of those things you have an intuition about but can’t seem\\nto explain.”</p>\\n<p>I’ve talked with many developers and what seems to help most is a combination of\\nmetaphors with actual code examples. So buckle up cause I’m about to #preach.</p>\\n<p>Let’s go back to the initial definition I made fun of, “Imperative programming is\\nlike “How” you do something and declarative programming is more like “What” you\\ndo.” There’s actually SOME good information hidden in here. Let’s first see the\\nmerit in this definition by taking it out of the context of programming and look\\nat a “real life” example.</p>\\n<p>You decide that you’ve been spending too much time arguing about “JavaScript\\nFatigue” ™ and Reactive Functional Programming, and your husband deserves a nice\\ndate. You decide to go to Red Lobster since you’ve been listening to a lot of\\nBeyonce lately. 👑🐝. You arrive at Red Lobster, approach the front desk and\\nsay…</p>\\n<p><strong>An imperative approach (HOW)</strong>: I see that table located under the Gone Fishin’\\nsign is empty. My husband and I are going to walk over there and sit down.</p>\\n<p><strong>A declarative approach (WHAT)</strong>: Table for two, please.</p>\\n<p>The imperative approach is concerned with HOW you’re actually going to get a\\nseat. You need to list out the steps to be able to show HOW you’re going to get\\na table.The declarative approach is more concerned with WHAT you want, a table\\nfor two.</p>\\n<p>“Ok.” — your brain</p>\\n<p>More metaphors!</p>\\n<p>I’m going to ask you a question. I want you to think of both an imperative\\nresponse and a declarative response.</p>\\n<p>“I’m by Wal-Mart. How do I get to your house from here?”</p>\\n<hr>\\n<hr>\\n<hr>\\n<p>An imperative response: Go out of the north exit of the parking lot and take a\\nleft. Get on I-15 south until you get to the Bangerter Highway exit. Take a\\nright off the exit like you’re going to Ikea. Go straight and take a right at\\nthe first light. Continue through the next light then take your next left. My\\nhouse is #298.</p>\\n<p>A declarative response: My address is 298 West Immutable Alley, Draper Utah\\n84020</p>\\n<p>Regardless of how I get to your house, what really matters is the car I drive.\\nAm I going to drive an <em>imperative</em> stick shift car or a <em>declarative</em> automatic\\ncar. Enough metaphors?</p>\\n<p>Before we dive into code, it’s important to realize thatmany declarative\\napproaches have some sort of imperative abstraction layer. Look at all of our\\nexamples:</p>\\n<p>The declarative response to the Red Lobster employee is assuming that the Red\\nLobster employee knows all the imperative steps to get us to the table. Knowing\\nthe address assumes you have some sort of GPS that knows the imperative steps of\\nhow to get to your house.</p>\\n<p>Anautomatic car has some sort of abstraction layer overshifting gears.</p>\\n<p>That was the realization that really made it click for me, soI’ll repeat it:\\nMany (if not all) declarative approacheshave some sort of underlying imperative\\nabstraction.</p>\\n<p>If that sentence makes sense, you’re doing great!</p>\\n<p>Now, we’re going to attempt to take the leap from metaphorical happy land to\\nreal world code land. To make the leap more graceful, let’s look at some\\nprogramming “languages” that are inherently declarative versus those which are\\nimperative by nature.</p>\\n<p>Imperative: C, C++, Java<br> Declarative: SQL, HTML<br> (Can Be) Mix:\\nJavaScript, C#, Python</p>\\n<p>Think about your typical SQL or HTML example,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-sql\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">SELECT</span> * <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">FROM</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">Users</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">WHERE</span> Country=’Mexico’;\\n</code></pre>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">article</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">header</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">h1</span>&gt;</span>Declarative Programming<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">h1</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">p</span>&gt;</span>Sprinkle Declarative in your verbiage to sound smart<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">p</span>&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">header</span>&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">article</span>&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>By glancing at both examples, you have a very clear understanding of what is\\ngoing on. They’re both declarative. They’re concerned with WHAT you want done,\\nrather than HOW you want it done.</p>\\n<p>You’re describing what you’re trying to achieve, without instructing how to do\\nit. The implementation of selecting all of the users who live in Mexico has been\\nabstracted from you. You’re not concerned with how the web browser is parsing\\nyour <em>article</em> and displaying it to the screen. Your WHAT is <em>Mexican users</em> and\\na <em>new header</em> and <em>paragraph</em> on your website.</p>\\n<p>So far so good. Let’s dive into more practical JavaScript examples.</p>\\n<p>I want you to pretend you’re now in a technical interview and I’m the\\ninterviewer. Open up your console and answer the following questions.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Write a function called <em>double</em> which takes in an array of numbers and returns\\na new array after doubling every item in that array. <em>double([1,2,3]) -&gt;\\n[2,4,6]</em></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Write a function called <em>add</em> which takes in an array and returns the result of\\nadding up every item in the array. <em>add([1,2,3]) -&gt; 6</em></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Using jQuery (or vanilla JavaScript), add a <em>click</em> event handler to the element\\nwhich has an id of <em>btn</em>. When clicked, toggle (add or remove) the\\n<em>highlight</em> class as well as change the text to <em>Add Highlight</em> or <em>Remove\\nHighlight</em> depending on the current state of the element.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Let’s look at the most common approaches to these problems, which all happen to\\nalso be imperative approaches.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">double</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">arr</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">let</span> results = []\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">let</span> i = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>; i &lt; arr.length; i++){\\n    results.push(arr[i] * <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>)\\n  }\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> results\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<ol start=\\\"2\\\">\\n<li></li>\\n</ol>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">add</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">arr</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">let</span> result = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">let</span> i = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>; i &lt; arr.length; i++){\\n    result += arr[i]\\n  }\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> result\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\\n<li></li>\\n</ol>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">$(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"#btn\\\"</span>).click(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  $(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>).toggleClass(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"highlight\\\"</span>)\\n  $(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>).text() === <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Add Highlight'</span>\\n    ? $(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>).text(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Remove Highlight'</span>)\\n    : $(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>).text(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Add Highlight'</span>)\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>By examining what all three of these imperative examples have in common, we’ll\\nbe able to better identify what actually makes them imperative.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>The most obvious commonality is that they’re describing <strong>HOW</strong> to do something.\\nIn each example we’re either explicitly iterating over an array or explicitly\\nlaying out steps for how to implement the functionality we want.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>This one might not be as obvious if you’re not used to thinking in the\\n<em>declarative</em> or even more specifically <em>functional</em> way. In each example\\nwe’re mutating some piece of state (If you’re unfamiliar with the term state,\\nit’s basically information about something held in memory — which should sound a\\nlot like variables). In the first two examples we create a variable called\\nresults and then we continually modify it. In the third example we don’t have\\nany variables, but we still have state living in the DOM itself — we then modify\\nthat state in the DOM.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>This one is a bit subjective, but to me the code above isn’t very readable. I\\ncan’t just glance at the code and understand what’s going on. My brain needs to\\nstep through the code just as an interpreter wouldwhile also taking into account\\nthe context in which the code lives(another negativity of mutable data).</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>All right, enough 💩ing on the code. Let’s now take a look at some declarative\\nexamples. The goal is to fix all the problems from above. So each example needs\\nto describe <strong>WHAT</strong> is happening, can’t mutate state, and should be readable at a\\nglance.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li></li>\\n</ol>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">double</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">arr</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> arr.map(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">item</span>) =&gt;</span> item * <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>)\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<ol start=\\\"2\\\">\\n<li></li>\\n</ol>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">add</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">arr</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> arr.reduce(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">prev, current</span>) =&gt;</span> prev + current, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>)\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\\n<li></li>\\n</ol>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">&lt;Btn\\n  onToggleHighlight={this.handleToggleHighlight}\\n  highlight={this.state.highlight}&gt;\\n    {this.state.buttonText}\\n&lt;/Btn&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Much better 🤓</p>\\n<p>Notice that in the first two example we’re leveraging JavaScript’s built in <em>map</em>\\nand <em>reduce</em> methods. This goes back to what we’ve been talking about over and\\nover in this article that most declarative solutions are an abstraction over\\nsome imperative implementation.</p>\\n<p>In every example we’re describing WHAT we want to happen rather than HOW (we\\ndon’t know HOW map and reduce are implemented, we also don’t care). We’re not\\nmutating any state. All of the mutations are abstracted inside of <em>map</em> and\\n<em>reduce</em>. It’s also more readable (once you get used to <em>map</em> and <em>reduce</em>, of\\ncourse).</p>\\n<p>Now what about #3? Well I cheated a little bit, and am using\\n<a href=\\\"http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals\\\">React</a> — but\\nnote that all three imperative mistakes are still fixed. The real beauty of\\nReact is that you can create these declarative user interfaces. By looking at\\nour Btn component, I’m able to easily understand what the UI is going to look\\nlike. Another benefit is instead of state living in the DOM, it lives in the\\nReact component itself.</p>\\n<p>Another less-spoken-of benefit to declarative code is that your program can be\\ncontext-independent. This means that because your code is concerned with what the\\nultimate goal is— rather than the steps it takes to accomplish that goal — the\\nsame code can be used in different programs, and work just fine.</p>\\n<p>Look at all three of our examples above. We can consume both functions and\\ncomponent in any program we want. They’re program agnostic. This is hard to do\\nwith imperative code because often times, by definition, imperative code relies\\non the context of the current state.</p>\\n<p>One thing that I didn’t go too far into is how functional programming is a\\nsubset of declarative programming. If you haven’t already, I highly recommend\\ngetting more familiar with functional programming techniques in JavaScript.\\nStart with <em>.map</em>, <em>.reduce</em>, <em>.filter</em> and work your way up from there.</p>\\n<p>Odds are there isn’t a lower hanging fruit to improve your codebase than making\\nit more functional.</p>\\n<p>Here are some other definitions that I’ve found on the internet that may or may not be helpful.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Declarative programming is “the act of programming in languages that conform to\\nthe mental model of the developer rather than the operational model of the\\nmachine”.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Declarative Programming is programming with declarations, i.e. declarative\\nsentences.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The declarative property is where there can exist only one possible set of statements that can express each specific modular semantic.The imperative\\nproperty is the dual, where semantics are inconsistent under composition and/or\\ncan be expressed with variations of sets of statements.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Declarative languages contrast with imperativelanguages which <strong>specify explicit\\nmanipulation of the computer’s internal state</strong>; or procedural languages which\\nspecify an explicit sequence of steps to follow.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm that\\nexpresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2016-07-13-imperative-vs-declarative/index.md\n// module id = 454\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"\\\"create-react-app\\\" and the future of creating React applications\",\"date\":\"2016-07-22T16:35:26.778Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/create-react-app-and-the-future-of-creating-react-applications/\",\"body\":\"<p>Over the past few years, I’ve been heavily involved with teaching people how to\\nbuild applications with React.js.

Then came\\n<a href=\\\"https://egghead.io/courses/build-your-first-react-js-application\\\">Egghead</a>.\\nThen came <a href=\\\"http://reactjsprogram.com/\\\">React.js Program</a>.</p>\\n<p>Throughout all of these, one thing was consistent: getting started with\\na React application was <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/708675139253174273\\\">pretty\\noverwhelming</a>, for\\nboth beginners and senior developers alike.</p>\\n<p>Yes, we’re building better quality apps than we’ve ever built. Yes, even a few\\nyears ago we had nothing comparable to the tooling we have now. Yes, the end\\nresult is worth it. But that doesn’t make it any easier for someone who just\\nwants to get to “Hello World.”</p>\\n<p>This is why I’m excited about <strong>create-react-app</strong>.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\\\">create-react-app</a></strong> is\\nan <strong>official</strong> command line interface (CLI) for building React applications\\nwith no build configuration.</p>\\n<p>To get started, do this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">npm install -g create-react-app\\ncreate-react-app Awesome\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You’ll get output that looks like this:</p>\\n<p>This is huge! If you’re just getting started with React, you should probably\\ntake a break and just relish this moment.</p>\\n<p>Now, when you build a React app, you don’t <em>need</em> to know the secret combination\\nof Webpack and Babel. You can just focus on what you really care about: building\\nthe actual app.</p>\\n<p>If we <strong>cd</strong> into our <strong>Awesome</strong> project, we’ll have a folder structure that\\nlooks like this:</p>\\n<pre><code>Awesome/\\n  README.md\\n  index.html\\n  favicon.ico\\n  node_modules/\\n  package.json\\n  src/\\n    App.css\\n    App.js\\n    index.css\\n    index.js\\n    logo.svg\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and a very minimal package.json:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">{\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"name\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Awesome\\\"</span>,\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"version\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"0.0.1\\\"</span>,\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"devDependencies\\\"</span>: {\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react-scripts\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"0.1.0\\\"</span>\\n   },\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"dependencies\\\"</span>: {\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"^15.2.1\\\"</span>,\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react-dom\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"^15.2.1\\\"</span>\\n   },\\n   <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"scripts\\\"</span>: {\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"start\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react-scripts start\\\"</span>,\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"build\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react-scripts build\\\"</span>,\\n     <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"eject\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"react-scripts eject\\\"</span>\\n   }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You’ll notice you have three options: <strong>start</strong>, <strong>build</strong>, and <strong>eject</strong>.</p>\\n<p><strong>start</strong> is what you’re probably already familiar with. It will start up a\\nlocal development server on <strong>localhost:3000</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>build</strong> will prep your app for production by correctly bundling React in\\nproduction mode (by setting NODE_ENV to <em>production</em>), minifying your code (with\\nfilename hashing), and outputting the result to a <strong>build</strong> folder.</p>\\n<p><strong>eject</strong> is the interesting one.

eslint.js\\n    webpack.config.dev.js\\n    webpack.config.prod.js\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So it’s just like we described above: all of the configuration settings that\\nwere abstracted from us earlier have now been moved into our project, so we have\\ndirect control over them from that point on.</p>\\n<p>There are some other great features, besides just the ability to <strong>eject</strong>. I\\nthink the main goal of this project was to take the &quot;most common denominator&quot;\\nfeatures, if you will, and tie them into a CLI.</p>\\n<p>Out of the box you get:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>React, JSX, ES6 (and some ES+)</li>\\n<li>the ability to import CSS and images directly from JavaScript</li>\\n<li>CSS, which is automagically autoprefixed</li>\\n<li>a production build script as we talked about earlier</li>\\n<li>a development server, which will lint for common errors</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>All of which are pretty fundamental and universal for building a React app.</p>\\n<p>Now, with that said, you’ll notice there are some pretty fundamental pieces\\nstill missing.</p>\\n<p>It’s difficult to make so many decisions without trudging over the &quot;opinionated&quot;\\nline. This project is opinionated, and with those opinions comes tradeoffs.</p>\\n<p>The README points out that there’s still no support for the following</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>testing</li>\\n<li>server Rendering</li>\\n<li>some experimental syntax extensions (like decorators)</li>\\n<li>CSS Modules</li>\\n<li>LESS or Sass</li>\\n<li>hot reloading of components</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This might be a deal breaker for some of you. Many of those things have become\\nstandard for building a real “production grade” React app. However, if you’re\\nthe type of person who is doing Server Side Rendering along with decorators,\\nyou’re most likely not the target market here.</p>\\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\\n<p>Overall, I’m excited for this project. It benefits the part of the community\\nwhich desperately needed more guidelines and help getting started while not\\nreally affecting everyone else who already had their own process.</p>\\n<p>Do I think you should still learn Webpack and Babel? Absolutely. But now, that\\ndecision is up to you.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2016-07-22-create-react-app/index.md\n// module id = 455\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"400: My Declarative Approach to Accomplishing Goals\",\"date\":\"2016-08-01T18:12:03.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/400-my-declarative-approach-to-accomplishing-goals-9d2e1d2e5307/\",\"body\":\"<p>As the amount of items we need to finish for a given day grows, one or both of\\nthese natural tendencies seem to occur.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>We become complacent with what we’ve already achieved.</li>\\n<li>We become overwhelmed with everything else we still need to achieve.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>This phenomenon is so common that it’s become a very overplayed meme.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*hDMwe57oOA3iXKeOnHsPIA.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>My hope is that there’s a solution, and that the solution can be found from a\\nfundamental principle of the software world — finding the right abstraction.</p>\\n<p>Everyday both in software and in the real world we deal with different levels of\\nabstraction. When you start your car, you don’t need to worry about sending a\\nsignal to your starter solenoid, rotating your flywheel, or making sure fuel is\\nproperly mixed with air and sent to your piston cylinder device — all of that is\\nabstracted away from you so you can focus on driving to your destination. When\\nyou create a React component you’re (typically) not concerned with how React’s\\nreconciliation process works to make DOM diffing more effective —\\nReact.Component is an abstraction layer over that complexity. This allows you to\\nfocus on what is more important to you, which is probably building great user\\ninterfaces.</p>\\n<p>The right abstraction will offer huge dividends while the wrong abstraction can\\nbe detrimental to a project.</p>\\n<p>Theoretically, this same principle can apply to our goals as well. The right\\nabstraction layer over our goals will allow us to focus on our own personal\\nprogression while the wrong (or no) abstraction layer will leave us overwhelmed\\nwhile focusing on the implementation details.</p>\\n<p>Essentially I want to take a more\\n<a href=\\\"https://medium.freecodecamp.com/imperative-vs-declarative-programming-283e96bf8aea\\\">declarative</a>\\napproach to accomplishing my goals.</p>\\n<p>Before creating an abstraction, we need to know what we’re going to abstract.\\nWe’ll be attempting to abstract my goals for the month of August.</p>\\n<p>For some context if you don’t know me. I’m the sole engineer of a startup called\\n<a href=\\\"http://speroforcancer.com/\\\">Spero</a> which is connecting everyone in the world\\naffected by Cancer. We’re currently in beta on iOS only and in the next month we\\nhope to launch on Android as well as launch out of beta. I run <a href=\\\"http://reactjsprogram.com/\\\">React.js\\nProgram</a> which is a linear approach to learning the\\nReact ecosystem. I currently have three of the eventual five courses finished\\nand there are 27,000 very friendly students encouraging me to finish the final\\ntwo courses. I’m co-authoring a book on React called <a href=\\\"https://www.fullstackreact.com/\\\">Full Stack\\nReact</a>. I’m also married (with no kids).</p>\\n<p>My August goals.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Launch Spero Updates</li>\\n<li>Launch Spero on Android</li>\\n<li>Launch more Spero updates to go “out of beta”</li>\\n<li>Start (and finish) the React Native section for Full Stack React book.</li>\\n<li>Blog 5 times</li>\\n<li>Launch React.js Program’s “<a href=\\\"http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactnative\\\">React\\nNative</a>” course</li>\\n<li>Update React.js Program’s “<a href=\\\"http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals\\\">React\\nFundamentals</a>”\\ncourse</li>\\n<li>Exercise 4X a week (and eat healthy, etc etc)</li>\\n<li>Some more personal/family goals I won’t list here</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If I get caught up in the implementation details, I’ll fail. I always do. I tend\\nto focus on the fact that I “have so much to do” rather than focus on “doing”.</p>\\n<p>The obvious abstraction over those goals is in using productive hours in order\\nto generalize “accomplishment”.</p>\\n<p><em>Productive Hours = Hours Logged * Productivity Percentage</em></p>\\n<p>My hope is that by focusing entirely on increasing the amount of productive\\nhours I output, I’ll limit feeling overwhelmed with the details while maximizing\\nmy productivity.</p>\\n<p>After analyzing all of my goals, I think the realistic number of productive\\nhours it will take to accomplish them is <strong>400</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Now comes the question of measuring productivity. This one is easier than it\\nseems. I’m using <a href=\\\"http://rescuetime.com/\\\">Rescue Time</a> which keeps track of my\\ntime spent on my computer and gives me a daily/weekly/monthly breakdown of total\\ntime and also gives me a productivity score for that time.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0ZIsysM4QOHtwO78L_g1mg.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>The only other metric that will count towards my “total productive hours” count\\nis exercise which is easily trackable. *<em>Note. I won’t be including any\\n“personal/family” goals in the 400 hours but be confident that my Wife and I\\nhave a very loving and happy relationship, despite the crazy hours.</em></p>\\n<p>In order to hit 400 productive hours, I assume I’ll have to work ~15 hour days\\nfor the month of August. I recognize I’m extremely lucky/blessed/privileged that\\nI can focus so much attention on these superficial things but I plan to take\\nadvantage of that as long as I can.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2016-08-01-400-my-declarative-approach-to-goals/index.md\n// module id = 456\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"How to Install the Facebook SDK into a React Native Android or iOS App\",\"date\":\"2016-08-11T16:28:46.001Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/installing-the-facebook-sdk-into-a-react-native-android-and-ios-app/\",\"body\":\"<p>So I made this snarky tweet at 4 a.m. This is my peace offering.</p>\\n<markup>\\n  <blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&quot;I have not failed.

In\\norder to answer this question, we need to take a deep dive into that\\nabstraction.</p>\\n<p>Let’s start by looking at the absolute fundamentals of React. What is React?\\nIt’s a library for building user interfaces. No matter how complex React or the\\nReact ecosystem seem to be, this is React at its core — building UIs. With this\\nin mind, we arrive at our first definition, an <strong>Element</strong>. Simply put, <em>a React\\nelement describes what you want to see on the screen</em>. Not so simply put, <em>a\\nReact element is an object representation of a DOM node</em>. Notice I used the word\\n<em>describe</em>. It’s important to note that a React element isn’t actually the thing\\nyou’ll see on your screen, instead, it’s just an object representation of it.\\nThere’s a few reasons for this. The first is that JavaScript objects are\\nlightweight — React can create and destroy these elements without too much\\noverhead. The second reason is React is able to analyze the object, then analyze\\nthe actual DOM, and then update the actual DOM only where a change occurred.\\nThis has some performance upsides to it.</p>\\n<p>In order to create our object representation of a DOM node (aka React element),\\nwe can use React’s <em>createElement</em> method.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> element = React.createElement(\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'div'</span>,\\n  {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">id</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'login-btn'</span>},\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Login'</span>\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><em>createElement</em> takes in three arguments. The first is a tag name string (div,\\nspan, etc), the second is any attributes you want the element to have, the third\\nis contents or the children of the element, in this case the text “Login”. The\\n<em>createElement</em> invocation above is going to return an object with this shape,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'div'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Login'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">id</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'login-btn'</span>\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and when it’s rendered to the DOM (using ReactDOM.render), we’ll have a new DOM\\nnode that looks like this,</p>\\n<pre><code>&lt;div id='login-btn'&gt;Login&lt;/div&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So far, so good. What’s interesting about learning React is that typically the\\nfirst thing you’re taught is components. “Components are the building blocks of\\nReact”. Notice, however, that we started this post with elements. The reason for\\nthis is because once you understand elements, understanding components is a\\nsmooth transition. <em>A component is a function or a Class which optionally\\naccepts input and returns a React element.</em></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Button</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ onLogin }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> React.createElement(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'div'</span>,\\n    {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">id</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'login-btn'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>: onLogin},\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Login'</span>\\n  )\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>By definition, we have a Button component which accepts an onLogin input and\\nreturns a React element. One thing to note is that our Button component receives\\nan <em>onLogin</em> method as its prop. To pass that along to our object representation\\nof the DOM, we pass it along as the second argument to createElement, just as we\\ndid our id attribute.</p>\\n<p>Let’s go deeper.</p>\\n<p>Up until this point we’ve only covered creating React elements with the “type”\\nproperty of native HTML elements (“span”, “div”, etc), but you can also pass in\\nother React components to the first argument of createElement.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> element = React.createElement(\\n  User,\\n  {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">name</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler McGinnis'</span>},\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>However, unlike with an HTML tag name, if React sees a <em>class <em>or a</em> function</em>\\nas the first argument, it will then check to see what element it renders, given\\nthe corresponding props. React will continue to do this until there are no more\\ncreateElement invocations which have a class or a function as their first\\nargument. Let’s take a look at this in action.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Button</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> React.createElement(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"button\\\"</span>,\\n    { <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>: addFriend },\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Add Friend\\\"</span>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">User</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ name, addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> React.createElement(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"div\\\"</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>,\\n    React.createElement(\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"p\\\"</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>,\\n      name\\n    ),\\n    React.createElement(Button, { addFriend })\\n  )\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Above we have two components. A Button and a User. User’s object representation\\nof the DOM will be a “div” with two children, a “p” which wraps the user’s name\\nand a Button component. Now let’s swap out the createElement invocations with\\nwhat they return,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Button</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'button'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>: addFriend,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Add Friend'</span>\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">User</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ name, addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'div'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: [\\n        {\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'p'</span>,\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n            <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: name\\n          }\\n        },\\n        {\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: Button,\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n            addFriend\\n          }\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You’ll notice in the above code we have four different type properties,\\n“button”, “div”, “p”, and Button. When React sees an element with a function or\\nclass type (like our <em>“type: Button”</em> above), it will then consult with that\\ncomponent to know which element it returns, given the corresponding props. With\\nthat in mind, at the end of this process, React has a full object representation\\nof the DOM tree. In our example, that will look like this,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'div'</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: [\\n      {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'p'</span>,\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Tyler McGinnis'</span>\\n        }\\n      },\\n      {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'button'</span>,\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">props</span>: {\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>: addFriend,\\n          <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">children</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Add Friend'</span>\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This whole process is called reconciliation in React and it’s triggered every\\ntime setState or ReactDOM.render is called.</p>\\n<p>So now let’s again take a look at our initial question that sparked this blog\\npost,</p>\\n<figure>\\n  <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis33/status/771087982858113024\\\">\\n    <img style=\\\"margin: 0px auto; border-radius: 5px\\\" src='component-element.jpg' />\\n  </a>\\n</figure>\\n<p>At this point we have all the knowledge we need to answer this question except\\nfor one important piece. Odds are if you’ve been using React for any amount of\\ntime, you don’t use React.createElement to create your object representations of\\nthe DOM. Instead, you’re probably using JSX. Earlier I wrote “The primary reason\\nfor the confusion is that there’s an often un-talked about abstraction layer\\nbetween JSX and what’s actually going on in React land.”. This abstraction layer\\nis that <em>JSX is always going to get transpiled to React.createElement\\ninvocations (typically) via Babel.</em></p>\\n<p>Looking at our earlier example, this code</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Button</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> React.createElement(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"button\\\"</span>,\\n    { <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>: addFriend },\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Add Friend\\\"</span>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">User</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ name, addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> React.createElement(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"div\\\"</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>,\\n    React.createElement(\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"p\\\"</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>,\\n      name\\n    ),\\n    React.createElement(Button, { addFriend })\\n  )\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>is the result of this JSX being transpiled.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Button</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{addFriend}</span>&gt;</span>Add Friend<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">button</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">User</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">{ name, addFriend }</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">p</span>&gt;</span>{name}<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">p</span>&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">addFriend</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{addFriend}/</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">div</span>&gt;</span>\\n  )\\n}\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>So finally, what do we call it when we write out our component like this,\\n<code>&lt;Icon/&gt;</code>?</p>\\n<p>We can call it “creating an element” because after the JSX is transpiled,\\nthat’s exactly what’s happening.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">React.createElement(Icon, <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>All of these examples, are “creating a React element”</p>\\n<pre><code>React.createElement(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'div'</span>, className: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'container'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Hello!'</span>)\\n\\n&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">div</span> className=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'container'</span>&gt;Hello!&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">div</span>&gt;\\n\\n&lt;Hello /&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>For more reading on this subject see <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/12/18/react-components-elements-and-instances.html\\\">“React Components, Instances, and Elements”</a> by Dan Abramov.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./articles/2016-12-15-react-elements-vs-react-components/index.md\n// module id = 458\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"React \\\"Aha\\\" Moments\",\"date\":\"2016-12-21T11:12:03.284Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"/react-aha-moments/\",\"body\":\"<figure>\\n  <img style=\\\"margin: 0px auto; border-radius: 5px\\\" src='aha-small-min.jpg' />\\n</figure>\\n<p>One of my main goals whenever I’m teaching or writing technical content is to maximize “aha” moments. An <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect\\\">“aha” moment</a> is a moment of sudden insight or clarity; when the subject matter suddenly makes sense. We’ve all experienced them and the best teachers I know are able to understand their audience and adapt the lesson in order to maximize these moments.</p>\\n<p>Throughout the last few years I’ve taught React in just about every popular medium. Throughout that time I’ve been taking notes on what triggers these “aha” moments, specifically for learning React. About two weeks ago I came across <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/5gmywc/what_were_the_biggest_aha_moments_you_had_while/\\\">this Reddit thread</a> which had the same idea. So what I want to do in this post is share my collection of these moments while also adding my thoughts on some of the moments shared in that Reddit thread. Hopefully it will help React “click” for you if it hasn’t yet.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>fn(d) = V. Your UI is a function of your state and props are to components what arguments are to functions.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>One of the best parts of React is that you can use the same intuition that you have about JavaScript functions for when and where you should create React components. However, instead of your function taking in some arguments and returning a value, your function is going to take in some arguments and return an object representation of your UI. This idea can be summed up in the following formula, fn(d) = V. A Function takes in some Data and returns a View. This is a beautiful way to think about developing user interfaces because now your UI is just composed of different function invocations. This is how you’re already used to building applications and now you can take advantage of all of the benefits of function composition when building UIs.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>In React, your entire application’s UI is built using function composition and JSX is an abstraction over those functions.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The most common reaction I see from first timers using React is “React seems cool, but I really don’t like JSX. It breaks my separation of concerns”. JSX isn’t trying to be HTML, and it’s definitely more than just a templating language. There are two important things to realize with JSX. First, <a href=\\\"https://tylermcginnis.com/react-elements-vs-react-components/\\\">JSX is an abstraction over <em>React.createElement</em></a> which is a function that returns an object representation of the DOM. I know that was wordy but the tl;dr is that whenever you write JSX, once it’s transpiled, you’ll have a JavaScript object which represents the actual DOM (or whatever View is representative of the platform you’re on, iOS, Android, etc). Then React is able to analyze that object, analyze the actual DOM, and by doing a diff, update the DOM only where a change occurred. This has some performance upsides to it but more importantly shows that JSX really is “just JavaScript”. Second, because JSX is just JavaScript, you get all the benefits that JavaScript provides (composition, linting, debugging) but still with the declarativeness (and familiarity) of HTML.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Components don’t necessary have to correspond to DOM nodes.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>When we first learn React we’re taught that “Components are the building blocks of React. They take in input and return some UI (descriptor)”. Does that mean that every component needs to directly return UI descriptors as we’re typically taught? What if we wanted to have a component render another component (Higher Order Component pattern)? What if we wanted a component to manage some slice of state and then instead of returning a UI descriptor, it returns a function invocation passing in the state (Render Props pattern)? What if we had a component that was in charge of managing sound rather than a visual UI, what would it return? What’s great about React is you don’t <strong>have</strong> to return typical “views” from your components. As long as what eventually gets returned is a React element, null, or false, you’re good.</p>\\n<p>You can return other components</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">render () {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">MyOtherComponent</span> /&gt;</span>\\n}\\n</span></code></pre>\\n<p>you can return function invocations</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">render () {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.props.children(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.someImportantState)\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>or, you can return nothing</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">render () {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">null</span>\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>I really enjoyed Ryan Florence’s <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp-NOggyz54\\\">React Rally talk</a> where he covers this principle more in depth.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“When two components need to share state, I need to lift that state up instead of trying to keep their states in sync.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>A component based architecture naturally makes sharing state more difficult. If two components rely on the same state, where should that state live? This was such a popular question that it spurred an entire ecosystem of solutions which eventually ended with Redux. Redux’s solution is to put that shared state in another location called a “store”. Components can then subscribe to any portions of the store they need and can also dispatch “actions” to update the store. React’s solution is to find the nearest parent of both of those components and have that parent manage the shared state, passing it down to the child components as needed. There are pros and cons to both approaches but it’s important to be aware that both solutions exist.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Inheritance is unnecessary in React, and both containment and specialization can be achieved with composition.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>React has always been, for good reason, very liberal in adopting functional programming principles. A precedent move away from inheritance and towards composition was when the release of React 0.13 made it clear React wasn’t adding support for Mixins with ES6 classes. The reason for this is because mostly everything that can be accomplished with Mixins (or inheritance) can also be accomplished through composition, but with less side effects. If you’re coming to React from an inheritance heavy mindset, this new way of thinking may be difficult and probably won’t feel too natural. Luckily there are some great resources to help. <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMtDGfHWpA\\\">Here’s one</a> that’s not React specific that I’ve enjoyed.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“The separation of container and presentational components.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>If you think about the anatomy of a React component, it usually involves some state, potentially some lifecycle hooks, and markup via JSX. What if, instead of having all of that in one component, we separate the state and the lifecycle hooks from the markup. This leaves us with two components. The first has state, life cycle methods, and is responsible for how the component works. The second receives data via props and is responsible for how the component looks. This approach allows us to have better reusability of our presentational components since they’re no longer coupled to the data they receive. I’ve also found that it allows you (and newcomers to your project) to better understand the structure of your application. You’re able to swap out the implementation of a component without seeing or caring about the UI and vice versa - designers can tweak the UI without ever having to worry about how those presentational components are receiving data.</p>\\n<p><em>For more on this topic, check out <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.q9tui51xz\\\">Presentational and Container Components</a>.</em></p>\\n<hr>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“If you try to keep most of your component pure, stateless things become a lot simpler to maintain.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>This is another benefit of separating your presentational components from your container components. State is the sidekick of inconsistency.
